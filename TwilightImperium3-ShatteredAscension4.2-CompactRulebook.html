<p><em><strong>By Cyrusa</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This rulebook is an attempt at rewriting the full Twilight Imperium 3 rules integrating the Shattered Ascension mod. The main goals were to be more concise and more precise (meaning less ambiguities in games).
To do this, I had to make some minor changes to the SA ruleset here and there. I have indicated the changes I made in comments such as this one so they stand out.</p>

<p><em><strong>Contradictions</strong></em><br>
If a wording would contradict with another (for example saying you can do something that another wording prevents), then either it explicitly refers to the other wording it is contradicting with, in which case it takes precedence, or it does not, in which case the default precedence order is:<br>
Action Card &gt; Political Card &gt; Racial Improvements &gt; Racial Abilities &gt; Technologies &gt; Rules from this rulebook</p>
<p><em><strong>Compliance</strong></em><br>
A player subject to negative effects (for example discard <em>3</em> Trade Goods) must fulfil them as far as able (if she only has <em>2</em> Trade Goods, she must discard them).</p>
<h2 id="overview">
<a id="user-content-overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>
<p>In a game of Twilight Imperium, 2 to 8 players take the role of varied great races fighting for supremacy in the galaxy after the ruling Lazax Empire has fallen. The game is played over several Rounds, during which players strive to <a href="#user-content-ClaimObjectives_StatusPhaseStep">claim Objectives</a> in order to score Victory Points. The first player to reach a predetermined number of Victory Points is declared the winner and the new Empress of the Galaxy.</p>

<p>Find an area of the table that is convenient for all players to reach. Designate this
space the <em>common play area</em>, and populate it with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shuffled Action Cards deck</li>
<li>Shuffled Polical Cards deck</li>
<li>Ground Force and Fighter tokens</li>
<li>Trade Goods tokens</li>
<li>Planet Cards deck</li>

<ul>
<li>8 Victory Points for 2-player games</li>
<li>10 Victory Points for normal games</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The race picking and Home System bidding now use the order given by the die roll, instead of starting with the highest roller and going clockwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Have each player roll a die. Remember the results, as they will be used in the following setup steps as well.</li>
<li>Starting with the highest rolling player and in <strong>decreasing rolling order</strong>, each player may either choose any availlable race to play or pass. The unchosen races form the pool of random races.</li>
<li>All players without a race are <strong>secretly</strong> dealt a random race from the pool. They may either keep them, or reshuffle them into the pool (without revealing them).</li>

Then in <strong>decreasing rolling order</strong> (looping), each player not currently holding a bid on a Home System either places a bid on a new Home System or overbid another player. This continues until all players hold a bid on a Home System location.</p>

<p>During the Action Phase, each player will take an <strong>Action</strong>, that can be either a <a href="#user-content-StrategicAction">Strategic Action</a>, a <a href="#user-content-TacticalAction">Tactical Action</a>, or <a href="#user-content-Passing">Passing</a>. The order in which players can take their Action is given by their <a href="#user-content-Initiative">initiative</a>, the player with the lowest initiative being the first to take an Action.<br>
This sequence (each player taking an Action) is repeated until all players have Passed, at which point the Action Phase ends and the Status Phase begins.</p>
<p><strong>Initiative</strong> <a name="user-content-Initiative"></a><br>
The <strong>initiative</strong> of a player is the number printed on her Strategy Card.</p>
<p><strong>Active Player</strong><br>
A player currently taking an Action is called the <strong>active player</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>"as an action"</strong><br>
Some effects in the game are used "as an action". This means that using such effects is done instead of taking an Action during the Action Phase.</p>

</h4>
<div>
<p>A Strategic Action corresponds to playing a Strategy Card. When a player performs a Strategic Action, she uses the <strong>Primary Ability</strong> of her Strategy Card, then other players, following the order defined by the Rotation Cycler (starting with either the left or right neighbour of the active player, depending on the orientation of the Rotation Cycler), may choose to use the <strong>Secondary Ability</strong> of the card.<br>
After that the used Strategy Card is flipped on its <em>inactive</em> side, and may not be used again this Round.</p>
<p><strong>Important: When performing a Strategic Action, the active player <em><strong>may not</strong></em> execute the Secondary Ability of the Strategy Card she is playing.</strong></p>

If all players have passed, the Action Phase ends and the <a href="#user-content-StatusPhase">Status Phase</a> starts.</p>

<p><strong>Activated System</strong><br>
A System is considered <strong>activated by a player</strong> when it contains a Command Counter from that player, preventing her units in it from acting again until the Command Counter is removed. However, most effects simply refer to <strong>activated</strong> and <strong>unactivated</strong> Systems without specifying any player, in which case the player is the one using the effect.</p>
<p><strong>Allegiances</strong> <a name="user-content-Allegiances"></a><br>
From the perspective of a given player:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Friendly</strong> units and planets are those she controls.</li>
<li>
<strong>Enemy</strong> units and planets are those that are controlled by other players.</li>
<li>
<strong>Neutral</strong> units and planets are those that are not controlled by any player.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most effects using these terms do not specify which player they use the perspective of. In these cases, the player is the one using the effect.</p>

</h6>
<div>
<div>
<p>You may not move ships present in activated Systems, unless they are in the System just activated.
For each ship you want to move, you have to plot a legal trajectory for it. A legal trajectory is a chain of <a href="#user-content-AdjoiningAdjacent">adjacent</a> Systems starting with the System containing the ship and ending with the System just activated. It must also satisfy the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>No System of the trajectory (except the System just activated) may contain <a href="#user-content-Allegiances">enemy</a> ships. (e.g. ships may not move through Systems containing enemy ships)</li>
<li>The ship must have a sufficient <a href="#user-content-MovementValue">movement value</a> to follow the trajectory. By default, moving from a System to an adjacent System costs 1 movement. For example, a ship with a <em>movement value</em> of 1 can only move in adjacent Systems.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Notes:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>A ship does not need to take the shortest trajectory towards its final destination.</em></li>
<li><em>Trajectories that start and end in the just activated System without leaving it are allowed, and constitute a movement.</em></li>

<p>During this step, units with the <a href="#user-content-SpaceCannon_unitAbility">Space Cannon (<em>n</em>)</a> ability that are in the System just activated may fire at a fleet in the System just activated. There are two possibilities:</p>

<p>I excluded the "Pay upkeep for Fleet Supply &gt; 8" step from the Status Phase sequence. It does not have enough effects in normal games to justify its word count and learning time. It could become part of a set of optional rules related to epic games with huge maps and high Victory Point goal.<br>
Made slight changes to the names of the step to better reflect their content<br>
Added a "Take back Agendas" step, where players have to take back their Agendas (the Political Cards they put in the Twilight Council zone during the Strategy Phase), if these agendas have not been voted on or discarded. Else, people would frequently just leave their Agenda in place face-up because they do not care, giving away precious informations to the opponents.<br>
Added a "Scuttling" step near the end of the sequence.
After the Strategy Phase and the Action Phase comes the Status Phase. During this phase, players claim objectives granting them Victory Points, unlock Racial Improvements, and "clean up the table" for the next Round.</p>

<p><em><strong>1) Claim Objectives</strong></em> <a name="user-content-ClaimObjectives_StatusPhaseStep"></a></p>
<p>Starting with the Speaker and following the Rotation Cycler, players may claim objectives to gain Victory points, eventually allowing them to win the game.</p>
<p><strong>Claiming an Objective</strong><br>
In order to claim an objective, a player must satisfy the requirements written on it, and not have already claimed it in the past (whether other players have already claimed it or not does not matter). The player then places a flag on the objective, and advances her flag on the Victory Point Track by the number of Victory Points granted by the objective.</p>
<p><strong>Claiming Limit</strong><br>
During a Claim Objective step, a player:</p>
<ul>
<li>May claim:
<ul>
<li>At most 1 revealed Public Objective (either from Stage 1 or <a href="#user-content-Stage2PublicObjectives">Stage 2</a> (Stage 2 Objectives may only be claimed if Stage 2 has been initiated))</li>
<li>At most 1 <a href="#user-content-SecretObjectives">Secret Objective</a> from her hand</li>
<li>The <a href="#user-content-PreliminaryObjectives">Preliminary Objective</a> (if it is still claimable)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Must claim:
<ul>
<li>All <a href="#user-content-SpecialObjectives">Special Objectives</a> she qualifies for</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stage 2 Public Objectives (Blue)</strong> <a name="user-content-Stage2PublicObjectives"></a><br>
Stage 2 Public Objectives are harder Objectives that grant more Victory Points than Stage 1 ones. However, a player may only claim a Stage 2 Public Objective if the number of revealed Stage 1 Public Objectives is equal or higher to the Victory Point goal of the game (10 by default).</p>
<p><strong>Preliminary Objectives (Grey)</strong> <a name="user-content-PreliminaryObjectives"></a>
At the end of a Round in which a Preliminary Objective has been claimed by at least one player, it becomes unclaimable by all other players for the rest of the game. This creates a race among players to score them as early as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Secret Objectives (Red)</strong> <a name="user-content-SecretObjectives"></a><br>
When claiming a Secret Objective, a player must reveal it and show she indeed meets its requirements. If she does not meet them, the Secret Objective is discarded.</p>
<p><strong>Special Objectives (Green)</strong><a name="user-content-SpecialObjectives"><br>
There are three kinds of Special Objectives:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>The Artifact Objectives</em> award Victory Points to the players controlling some of the four <a href="#user-content-Artifact">Artifacts</a>.</li>
<li>
<em>Sovereign and Imperial</em> award Victory Points to the players controlling more than 8 and 12 planets outside their <a href="#user-content-HomeSystems">Home Systems</a> respectively.</li>
<li>
<em>Voice of the Council</em> awards a Victory Point to the player that was elected <a href="#user-content-VoiceOfTheCouncil">Voice of the Council</a> during the <a href="#user-content-TwilightCouncilAndPoliticalCards">Twilight Council</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Special Objectives differ from the other kinds of objective in that if a player that has claimed one of them stop meeting its requirements, her claim on the Special Objective is lost <strong>instantly</strong>: she must remove her flag from the objective card and loses the associated Victory Points <strong>immediately</strong>. This does not prevent her from claiming this objective again later in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Winning the game</strong><br>
After all players have finished claiming objectives, if at least one of them has the required amount of Victory Point (or more) that was decided at the start of the game, the game ends.<br>
Whoever has the most Victory Points at that time is declared winner. If two or more players have the same number of Victory Points, ties are broken in favour of the one controlling the most planets outside of his Home System. If there is still a tie, tied players share the victory.</p>
<p><em><strong>She has gained the power needed to claim the for too long empty Imperial Throne of Mecatol Rex. The Winnaran Custodians will step aside for their new Empress, who must lead the galaxy to a new age of prosperity, peace and enlightenment.</strong></em></p>
<p>Note that it is possible for a player to win the game outside of the Status Phase (some effects grant Victory Points during the Action Phase). If a player reaches the required amount of Victory Point at any time outside of the Status Phase, the game ends immediately and a victor is determined following the same procedure as above.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) Progression Feedback to Victory Point Leader</strong></em> <a name="user-content-ProgressionFeedback_StatusPhaseStep"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>New in SA</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The player with the most Victory Points gains as many Trade Goods as his Victory Point lead over the player with the second-most Victory Points.</p>
<p><em><strong>3) Unlock Racial Improvements</strong></em> <a name="user-content-UnlockRacialImprovements_StatusPhaseStep"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>New in SA<br>
Replaces "Racial Technology" with "Racial Improvement" to reduce the confusion, since the "Racial Technology" from the vanilla TI3 are actually not considered "Technologies" at all in SA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Starting with the Speaker and following the Rotation Cycler, each player may now unlock some of his <a href="#user-content-RacialImprovements">Racial Improvements</a> by spending resources.</p>
<p>The cost of unlocking a Racial Improvement is computed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base cost (printed on the card)</li>
<li>
<strong>-</strong> Victory Points (owned by the player)</li>
<li>
<strong>+</strong>
Base costs of the other Racial Improvements the player has already unlocked</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple Racial Improvements can be unlocked at the same time, but they must be unlocked one after the other.</p>
<p><em><strong>4) Produce Trade Goods (2:1)</strong></em> <a name="user-content-ProduceTradeGoods_StatusPhaseStep"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>New in SA</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Starting with the Speaker and following the Rotation Cycler, each player may spend resources to receive one Trade Good for each two resources spent.</p>
<p><em><strong>5) Refresh Planets</strong></em> <a name="user-content-RefreshPlanets_StatusPhaseStep"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>New in SA: Facilities are built at this step rather than during Tactical Action.<br>
Change: Refresh abilities are used by not refreshing the planet, instead of requiring the exhaustion of the planet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Starting with the Speaker, and following the Rotation Cycler, each player refreshes his planets, by turning the corresponding planet cards upright.<br>
Instead of refreshing a planet at this step, players may either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a <a href="#user-content-Facility">Facility</a> on the planet, provided it does not already have one.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="#user-content-RefreshAbility">refresh ability</a> of the planet, if it has one.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> "Instead of refreshing" means that the planet stays in the state it was in before this step. So for example, a refreshed planet on which a Facility is built stays refreshed.</p>
<p><em><strong>6) Receive 1 Action Card, 1 Political Card and 2 Command Counters</strong></em> <a name="user-content-ReceiveCardsAndCCs_StatusPhaseStep"></a></p>
<p>Starting with the Speaker and following the Rotation Cycler, each player draws one <a href="#user-content-ActionCards">Action Card</a>, one <a href="#user-content-TwilightCouncilAndPoliticalCards">Political Card</a>, and receives two <a href="#user-content-CommandCounters">Command Counters</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>7) Take back Agendas</strong></em> <a name="user-content-#user-content-TakeBackAgendas"></a></p>
<p>Players take back into their hand the Political Cards they placed as agendas in the Twilight Council during the previous Strategy Phase that were not included for voting or discarded during the Round.</p>
<p><em><strong>8) Reallocate Command Counters</strong></em> <a name="user-content-ReallocateCommandCounters_StatusPhaseStep"></a></p>
<p>Starting with the Speaker and following the Rotation Cycler, each player may redistribute his Command Counters between the Command Pool, Fleet Supply and Strategy Allocation areas of her race sheet.</p>
<p><em><strong>9) Scuttle units and break Trade Agreements</strong></em> <a name="user-content-Scuttling_StatusPhaseStep"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Change to SA: Trade Agreements could be broken at any time during the Status Phase. But it was annoying to see people breaking them to get 1 Trade Good and buy a racial improvement, so I decided to limit this possibility to this step of the Status Phase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Starting with the Speaker and following the Rotation Cycler, players may scuttle some of their units on the board by placing them in <a href="#user-content-Reinforcements">reinforcements</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>10) Remove Command Counters from the board, return Strategy Cards, repair units, refresh Space Docks</strong></em> <a name="user-content-CleanUp_StatusPhaseStep"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Command Counters on the board are removed and placed in <a href="#user-content-Reinforcements">reinforcements</a>.</li>
<li>Strategy Cards are returned to the common play area.</li>
<li>Units with used <a href="#user-content-SustainDamage_unitAbility">Sustain Damage abilities</a> are repaired.</li>
<li>Space Docks are refreshed</li>

<p><strong>Assigning a hit</strong> <a name="user-content-AssigningAHit"></a>:<br>
When her opponent generates a <em>hit</em> during a Space Battle or Invasion Combat, a player must assign it to one of her units involved in the SpaceBattle/InvasionCombat (she chooses which unit). Each unit may only be assigned at most one <em>hit</em>, and doing so destroys the unit.</p>
<p><strong>End of a Space Battle</strong>:<br>
If before a Combat Round would begin, either the attacker or the defender does not have ships in the System of the Space Battle, the Space Battle ends. If one player still has ships in the System at this point, she is declared the <strong>winner</strong> of the Space Battle.</p>

<p><em><strong>Special rules:</strong></em></p>

<p>[image of a Command Counter, with both sides]</p>
<p>Each player has a number of Command Counters. They are used for various purposes, which this section will explain. During the game, Command Counters can exist either in a player's reinforcements, on one of three dedicated zones of his race sheet, or in systems of the galaxy.</p>
<p>Whenever a player receives or gain a Command Counter, he must place it on his race sheets in one of the three following areas (she chooses which):</p>
<ul>
<li>Command Pool</li>
<li>Fleet Supply</li>
<li>Strategy Allocation</li>
</ul>
<p>Command Counters may not be moved from one area to another, except during the  <a href="#user-content-ReallocateCommandCounters_StatusPhaseStep">Reallocate Command Counters step</a>  of the Status Phase.</p>
<h3 id="command-pool-">

<p>The Command Counters in the Command Pool are used to perform Tactical Actions. If a player does not have any Command Counter in her Command Pool, she may not perform Tactical Actions.</p>

</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I changed the part about how to handle Fleet Supply excess. Instead of having both:</p>
<ul>
<li>"A player may never move units, build units, or otherwise acquire units in any system so that the number of ships herein (again, excluding Fighters) exceed the number of Command Counters in his Fleet Supply area. "</li>
<li>AND</li>
<li>"If, for any reason, the number of ships in a system should exceed the number of Command Counters in a player's Fleet Supply, the owner of those ships must immediately remove enough ships from the system (by placing them back with his reinforcements) until the number of ships is again in compliance with the number of Command Counters in his Fleet Supply area. "<br>
I went with only keeping the second.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Command Counters placed in Fleet Supply must be placed with the "fleet" side up.<br>
The number of Command Counters in a player's Fleet Supply is her <strong>Fleet Supply</strong>: the maximum number of non-Fighter ships she may have in any System at any time.</p>
<p>If a player has more non-Fighter Ships in a System than her Fleet Supply, she must destroy enough of her non-Fighter Ships in the System to comply with her Fleet Supply again.</p>
<p>The Fleet Supply constraint is <em>not</em> checked while ships are moving, but is checked right after all ships have finished their movement.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the <strong>Fleet Supply</strong> is a constraint on the number of non-Fighter ship of fleets, not on the number of fleets. For example, a player with 3 Fleet Supply may have as many fleets as she wants (up to one per System!), but none of these fleets may have more than 3 non-Fighter ships.</p>

</h2>
<p><strong>Agenda</strong><br>
Refers to the Political Cards that were placed in the Twilight Council zone during the Strategy Phase.</p>
<p>The Twilight Council concurs as part of the Assembly (3) Strategy Card Primary Ability.<br>
During this Primary Ability, the active player must choose a number of agendas to be voted on (see the Strategy Card), and select the order in which they will be resolved after being voted on.</p>
<h3 id="voting">
<a id="user-content-voting" class="anchor" href="#voting" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Voting</h3>
<ol>
<li>Each player calculates how many votes she has, by summing the influence values of all her <em>unexhausted</em> planets and potentially adding bonus votes granted by other effects.
If a player would have 0 votes, she gets 1 vote.</li>
<li>Players debate, threaten, lure, bribe or convince each other. Remember that no promises are binding.</li>
<li>Players take a piece of paper and a pen, and secretly write their votes. They must split their votes between the agendas and may not vote for two different outcomes of the same agenda, but they are not required to use all of their votes.<br>
For example, in order to place 3 votes on the FOR outcome of an agenda, a player would write: "NameOfTheAgenda: For 3" on his sheet.</li>
<li>All vote sheets are collected and votes are tallied. Then the agendas are resolved according to the outcome that got the more votes.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Ties</strong></em><br>
If multiple outcomes of the same agenda receive the same number of votes, the tie is broken by the <a href="#user-content-Speaker">Speaker</a>.<br>
Exception: an agenda that does not receive any vote is discarded without effect.</p>

<p><em><strong>"Elect"</strong></em><br>
Political Cards with the "elect" keywords ask the player to elect someone or something (depending on the card). The subject getting the most votes will be elected.</p>
<p><em><strong>"For or Against"</strong></em><br>
Political Cards with the "For or Against" keyword have only two outcomes: <em>For</em> and <em>Against</em>. The outcome receiving the more votes will be resolved.</p>
<p><em><strong>"Law"</strong></em><br>
Political Cards with the "Law" keyword represent permanent changes and will stay active after they were voted on.<br>
<strong>Exception:</strong> A "For or Against" Law of which the Against outcome is resolved does not stay active and is discarded.</p>

<p>[image]<br>
After the agendas being voted on have been designated and their resolution order has been chosen, any player may spend 1 Command Counter from Strategy Allocation to include the Voice of the Council Special Objective to the agendas being voted on.<br>
Voice of the Council is treated as a Law with the "elect player" keyword <em>for the duration of the vote</em> (it stops being considered as a Political Card after it). The player including it chooses where it is placed in the resolution order.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Technology" is the new name for the "Technology Advances" of the vanilla rulebook.
I renamed the yellow domain of technologies from "General technologies" to "Economic technologies". It does not have any in-game impact, but better represent what these technologies actually do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technologies represent scientific advances the players can acquire (research) throughout the game to strengthen the potential of their race. Technologies are presented in a Technology Tree and can be of one of these four colors, corresponding to four technological domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red: Warfare technologies</li>
<li>Green: Biotechnologies</li>
<li>Blue: Propulsion technologies</li>
<li>Yellow: Economic technologies</li>
</ul>

<a id="user-content-acquisition-of-technologies" class="anchor" href="#acquisition-of-technologies" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Acquisition of Technologies</h3>
<p><em><strong>Acquisition</strong></em><br>
Technologies are mostly acquired through the use of the Technology Strategy Card. When a player acquires a Technology, she places one of her flags on the corresponding Technology on the Technology Tree and benefit from its effects.</p>
<p><em><strong>Prerequisites</strong></em><br>
Some Technologies have other Technologies as prerequisites. This is indicated on the Technology Tree by lines: when two Technologies are connected by a line, the topmost Technology is a prerequisite of the other one. A player cannot acquire a Technology that has prerequisites without having acquired at least one of its prerequisites.<br>
Exception: When a '+' symbol in a red circle is present, both prerequisites are required.</p>
<p><em><strong>Purchases and Discounts</strong></em><br>
Some effects allow players to "purchase" Technology for a given resource price. This simply means the player may pay the required amount of resources to acquire a Technology.<br>
This cost is reduced by 1 if the player controls the <a href="#user-content-ArtifactTechnologyDiscounts">Artefact</a> of the same color than the purchased Technology, and by 1 for each <a href="#user-content-TechnologySpecialty">Technology Specialy</a> of the same color than the purchased Technology present on <em>refreshed</em> planets the player controls.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Racial Improvements were called "Racial Technologies" in the vanilla TI3 game, but since they do not work at all like "Technologies" and are not considered as such by the rules (for example for the objectives), this similarity in the name was source of confusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Racial Improvements are race-specific bonuses and abilities that can be unlocked during the game at the <a href="#user-content-UnlockRacialImprovements_StatusPhaseStep">Unlock Racial Improvement</a> step of the Status Phase.</p>

</h2>
<p>[image of a Trade Good]</p>
<p>When a player receives Trade Goods, she places them into the Trade Good Area of her race sheet. Whenever she spends resources or influence, she can decide to spend some of her Trade Goods as substitutes for one resource or influence each. For example if she wants to spend five resources, she can exhaust Planets for three resources and spend two Trade Goods.<br>
Spent Trade Goods are returned to the common play area.</p>
<p>Players are allowed to give other players Trade Goods from their Trade Good Area at any time. This makes the Trade Goods counter a flexible currency with which to bribe, pay, or assist other players economically.</p>

<p>Each race has two Trade Contracts, with numerical values printed on one of the sides (the Trade Agreement side). At the beginning of the game, players place these cards face down in their playing area (with the Trade Agreement side facing the table).</p>

<a id="user-content-opening-trade-agreements" class="anchor" href="#opening-trade-agreements" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Opening Trade Agreements</h3>
<p>Some effects (most notably the Primary Ability of the Trade Strategy Card) allow players to open Trade Agreements. When two players want to open a Trade Agreement with each other, they exhange one of their Trade Contracts and flip them (so the Trade Agreement sides are up).<br>
<strong>Restriction</strong>: two players may not have more than one Trade Agreements with each other.</p>

<p>Various effects (most notably the Primary Ability of the Trade Strategy Card) "place Trade Goods on active Trade Agreements". When this happens, players place, on their Trade Agreements, a number of Trade Goods equal to the numerical values of these Trade Agreements.<br>
Various effects (most notably the Primary and Secondary Ability of the Trade Strategy Card) allow players to collect the Trade Goods present on their Trade Agreements and place them in their Trade Goods Area.</p>

<a id="user-content-breaking-trade-agreements" class="anchor" href="#breaking-trade-agreements" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Breaking Trade Agreements</h3>
<p>There are multiple ways a Trade Agreement can be broken. The most common ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any player involved in a Trade Agreement may unilaterally break it during the <a href="#user-content-Scuttling_StatusPhaseStep">Scuttling and Breaking Trade Agreements</a> step of the Status Phase.</li>
<li>At the end of an action during which a player performed a <a href="#user-content-HostileAct">Hostile Act</a> against another, any Trade Agreements between these two players are broken.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a Trade Agreement is broken, the two players automatically collect a certain part of the Trade Goods present on their Trade Agreement (the other Trade Goods are discarded), then they flip the cards so that the Trade Agreement sides face the table and finally give the card back to their former trade partner.</p>
<p>How many Trade Goods get collected depends on how the Trade Agreement was broken:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it was broken due to a <a href="#user-content-HostileAct">Hostile Act</a>, the player that performed the hostile action collects none of the Trade Goods on her Trade Agreements, while her trade partner collects all the Trade Goods on her Trade Agreement.</li>
<li>If it was broken for any other reason, both players collect half (round down) of the Trade Goods on their Trade Agreement.</li>
</ul>

<p>The "Trade Contracts" of a race are the cards bearing its symbol, while its "Trade Agreements" are the Trade Contracts of other races it received when opening Trade Agreements with them.</p>
<h3 id="trading-example">
<a id="user-content-trading-example" class="anchor" href="#trading-example" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Trading Example</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Let us assume Letnev and Sol have opened a Trade Agreement. Letnev gave Sol one of his Trade Contract (value: 1), while Sol did the same (value: 2). So at this stage, Letnev has in its playing zone one of Sol's Trade Contracts with the Trade Agreement side face-up (showing the value of 2), while Sol has one of Letnev's Trade Contracts (showing the value of 1). Saying the same thing in a different way: Letnev has one of Sol's Trade Contract as Trade Agreement, and Sol has one of Letnev's Trade Contract as Trade Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let us assume that an effect placed Trade Goods on the Trade Agreements. So there are 2 Trade Goods on Letnev's Trade Agreement (Sol's Trade Contract in Letnev's playing zone), and 1 Trade Good on Sol's Trade Agreement (Letnev's Trade Contract in Sol's playing zone).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Letnev uses an effect allowing it to collect the Trade Goods on its Trade Agreements at this point, it would gain the 2 Trade Goods present on Sol's Trade Contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this Trade Agreement gets broken because Sol performed a hostile action against Letnev, Letnev would gain the all the Trade Goods on its Trade Agreement (2), while Sol would gain nothing and discard the Trade Good on its Trade Agreement. They would then exchange back the Trade Contracts and flip them (so the Trade Agreement side faces the table).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this Trade Agreement gets broken for another reason, Letnev would gain half round down of the Trade Goods on its Trade Agreement (1), while Sol would also gain half round down of the Trade Goods on its Trade Agreement (0).</p>

<p>Replaced the "when a Leader is on a planet that is lost or changes owner"+"when a Leader is part of a failed invasion" with the simpler: "When a Leader is present on a non-friendly planet without friendly Troops also being present"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a Ship carrying a Leader is destroyed, or when a Leader is present on a non-friendly planet without friendly Troops also being present, conduct a Fate Roll (roll a D10 and look at the following table) for the Leader at the end of the current action.</p>

<h5 id="fate-roll-table">

<ul>
<li><strong>1: Killed</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>2-7: Captured</strong><br>
Note: "Captured" requires enemy control of the planet or space where the Leader was situated. If these circumstances do not apply, treat this result as Escape Instead.</li>
<li><strong>8-10: Escape</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Killed:</strong> <a name="user-content-FateRollKilled"></a><br>
When Killed, the Leader is removed from the game entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Captured:</strong> <a name="user-content-FateRollCaptured"></a><br>
When Captured, the Leader becomes a captive, and the captor places one of her flags on the captive to denote this. A captive is considered as a Leader with no abilities, and may only be moved by the captor (as if it was one of his own Leaders). A captive that would be Captured by its original owner Escapes instead.</p>
<p><strong>Escape:</strong> <a name="user-content-FateRollEscape"></a><br>
Upon Escape, the original owner of the Leader may place it back in play at any of his planets or ship. A captive that escapes stops being a captive and regain its abilities.</p>

<p>I reworded the ability to let ships move through enemy ships. The case where the Diplomat is moving was a bit harder to word, since it had to explain that even though the movement of the ship carrying the Diplomat got stopped (for example by a Gravity Rift), then the other ships should still be able to go through the enemy ships. I split the ability in two parts to keep the wordings simpler: one when the Diplomat is moving, and one when it is static.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>I had to modify the wording of the second ability (the special retreat) to make it work cleanly. Unfortunately it made it longer, but I'm of the opinion that a wording that works is better thn a wording that is short.<br>
Aaaaand I also had to reword the third ability (the "please don't attack me" one) to make it work (and shorter), because it was using undefined terms like "invasion".</p>

<ul>
<li>When plotting it, the trajectory of a ship carrying a Diplomat may go through Systems containing enemy ships, provided the owners of these ships agree. Other ships may then also go through these Systems during the current action.</li>
<li>Ship trajectories may be plotted through a System containing a Diplomat and enemy ships if the owners of both agree.</li>
<li>After the Ships Movement step of a Tactical Action where Ships were moved into a system containing a Diplomat and an enemy fleet, the enemy fleet may, if the owners of both fleets and of the Diplomat comply, immediately retreat.

<p><strong>Activated System</strong><br>
A System is considered <strong>activated by a player</strong> when it contains a Command Counter from that player, preventing her units in it from acting again until the Command Counter is removed. However, most effects simply refer to <strong>activated</strong> and <strong>unactivated</strong> Systems without specifying any player, in which case the player is the one using the effect.
<strong>Activated Planet</strong><br>
By extension, a planet is "activated by [a player]" when it is in a System containing a Command Counter of that player.<br>
<strong>Activated Unit</strong><br>
Also by extension, a unit is "activated" when it is in a System containing a Command Counter of its owner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I improved most of these wordings from their SA version to add precision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the general rules regarding Domain Counters, see the <a href="#user-content-DomainCounters">Domain Counter section</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> All units created by Domain Counters are treated as regular units for all intents and purposes. </p>
<p><strong>Peaceful Annexation</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>The local civilization accepts the annexation into your galactic empire.</em><br>
Discard this counter.</p>
<p><strong>Void Space</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>Your ships travel deep into space, silently passing thousands of dead and empty planets. No unusual event occur.</em><br>
Discard this counter.</p>
<p><strong>Hidden Factory</strong>
[image]<br>
<em>Your exploratory units have unearthed an ancient, abandoned starship factory.</em><br>
You may produce ships for up to two production capacity in the system. One of the resources spent comes for free.</p>
<p><strong>Native Intelligence</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>The local civilizations offers their allegiance and share their research about distant starts.</em><br>
Secretly look at any face down Domain Counter on the board.</p>
<p><strong>Abandoned Freighters</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>An abandoned fleet of freighters drift in dead space, with cargo intact. The whereabouts of the crew remains a mystery.</em><br>
Immediately receive 2 Trade Goods.</p>
<p><strong>Uncharted Habitats</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>Amidst the dark between the stars you discover an advanced, self sustaining society previously not earlier registered in galactic records.</em><br>
Leave this counter in the system, and treat it as a Trade Station of 0 resource and 1 influence (no refresh ability). Take a Colony card to represent this habitat.</p>
<p><strong>Ship Graveyard</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>Remnants of a once great battle rests solemnly in space. Some of the ships may be repaired or looted for fuel and supplies.</em><br>
Either add one Command Counter to your Fleet Supply <em>or</em> produce one ship in the system costing no more than 2 production capacity, for half its resource cost (round down).</p>
<p><strong>Discovery</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>The venture through uncharted space has provided you with advantageous discoveries.</em><br>
Gain one Action Card or one Command Counter.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Wealth</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>The planet is rich on ore, gas, vegetation and other natural resources that can be extracted relatively easily.</em><br>
Place the indicated number of Trade Goods on the planet, that will work as Natural Wealth: players may take one of them when they gain control of the planet, when they activate the system while controlling the planet, and during the Refresh Planet step of the Status Phase if they control the planet.
Natural Wealth Trade Goods from multiple sources are merged.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial Society</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>An industrious and friendly populace welcomes your empire. With your help, they will soon be able to construct ships for interstellar travel.</em><br>
Receive a free (exhausted) Space Dock on this planet.</p>
<p><strong>Technological Legacy</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>The populace of this planet harbours relics and remnants of ancient Lazax technology.</em><br>
Receive one technology for which you have the needed pre-requisites, chosen by the player on your left.</p>
<p><strong>Alien Artifact</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>Strange, alien technology are identified in the system. After careful research, it reveals marvelous technological secrets your scientists cannot fully reproduce.</em><br>
Leave this counter where it was and choose a technology.
For the remainder of the game, whoever controls the Alien Artifact may use the effects of the chosen technology.
The control of this counter follows the same rules as the control of Artifacts.</p>
<p><strong>Neutron Radiation</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>The entire landing force is exposed to an intense pulsation of ionizing radiation. No survivors are reported.</em><br>
Roll a die for each landing ground unit. On a result of 5+, the unit is destroyed. Place a hit counter on the planet. The next time the planet would have been refreshed, the hit counter is removed instead.</p>
<p><strong>Lazax Survivors</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>The signs of intelligent life you detected turned out to be the very descendants of the great Lazax themselves.</em><br>
Treat this counter as a Leader. Instead of making Fate Rolls, it is captured and switches side (if the capture is impossible, remove the counter from play). The controlling player gains +3 votes.
Capturing the Lazax Survivors does not count towards objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Settlers</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>Pioneers from one of the Great Races have already settled on the planet.</em><br>
Roll a die to determine a random opponent, who places two Ground Forces on the planet and claim it. The active player may cancel both his landing and bombardment against this planet (units/Leaders unable to go back to where they came from are destroyed/make Fate Rolls).</p>
<p><strong>Gravity Rift</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>Your ships head into the midst of an uncharted gravity rift!</em><br>
Leave this counter in the system and treat it as a Gravity Rift while the counter is present.

<p><strong>Wormhole Discovery</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>investigating an anomaly in the sector reveals unexpected wormhole activity.</em><br>
Leave this counter in the system. Treat the system as having a wormhole of the indicated type while the counter is present.
Remove this counter at the end of the first action in which at least one ship moved out of this system through this wormhole.</p>
<p><strong>Space Pirates</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>Ruthless vagabond roam the galaxy to prey on the wealthy and the weak.</em>
Choose either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay 2 Trade Goods and remove this counter.</li>
<li>Conduct, as the attacker, a Space Battle against a neutral Dreadnought. If you win, receive two Trade Goods, else this counter stays in place.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fighter Ambush</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>Sensors detect a myriad of small, unidentified ships approaching at high velocity.</em><br>
If you have ships in the system, conduct, as the attacker, a Space Battle against the indicated number of neutral Fighters. If you do not win, or if you do not take control of the planet this counter is on (if it is on a planet), it stays in place.</p>
<p><strong>Sudden Collision</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>In the dead of space, unidentified objects slam into the hull and cargo area of your ships.</em><br>
Inflict a hit on one of your ships in the system <em>or</em> lose one unit carried by one of them. If you have the Antimass Deflectors technology, ignore this effect.</p>
<p><strong>Bio-Hazard</strong>
[image]<br>
<em>While attempting to terraform the planet, millions perish due to influence highly aggravating toxins.</em><br>
Inflict one hit on the landing army. If no ground units remain to claim the planet, leave this counter in place.</p>
<p><strong>Hostile Locals</strong>
[image]<br>
<em>All forms of Diplomacy with the local civilization have failed.</em><br>
Conduct, as the attacker, an Invasion Combat against the indicated number of neutral Ground Forces. If you do not take control of the planet, this counter stays in place.</p>
<p><strong>Automated Defence</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>Powerful laser beams soar through the atmosphere of the planet and cut into the hull of your ships.</em><br>
Two neutral PDSs will defend the planet. They immediately fire once each at your fleet in the system (if you have one).
These PDSs cannot be captured. If you win the Invasion Combat, receive a PDS on the planet, else leave this counter on the planet.</p>
<p><strong>Hostiles and Natural Wealth</strong><br>
[image]<br>
<em>The planet is abundant with natural resources, but the local populace will defend it at all costs.</em><br>
Roll one die and divide the result by two (round down). Replace this counter with both a Hostile Locals and a Natural Wealth Domain Counter of this value.</p>
