If the text of a component (card, technology,...) would contradict with the rules presented in this rulebook, the component takes precedence.</p>
<p><em><strong>Compliance</strong></em><br>
A player subject to negative effects (for example discard <em>3</em> Trade Goods) must fulfil them as far as able (if she only has <em>2</em> Trade Goods, she must discard them).</p>

<a id="user-content-overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>
<p>In a game of Twilight Imperium, 2 to 8 players take the role of varied great races fighting for supremacy in the galaxy after the ruling Lazax Empire has fallen. The game is played over several Rounds, during which players strive to fulfil Objectives in order to score Victory Points. The first player to reach a predetermined number of Victory Points is declared the winner and the new Empress of the Galaxy.</p>

</h2>
<p>Shattered Ascension is played over a consecutive number of Rounds. Each Round is split into three phases: The <a href="#user-content-StrategyPhase">Strategy Phase</a> where player place a Political Card in the Twilight Council and select their Strategy Card for the Round, the <a href="#user-content-ActionPhase">Action Phase</a>, where players use their Strategy Cards, move their ships, conquer planets and build units, and the <a href="#user-content-StatusPhase">Status Phase</a>, where the board is cleaned up and players can gain Victory Points by claiming Objectives. If no player is declared winner at the end of a Round, another Round starts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Each player must place face down a Political Card from their hand in the Twilight Council, and mark it with one of their flags. Political Cards placed in the Twilight Council zone in this manner are called <strong>Agendas</strong>. If the Twilight Council concurs this round, the Agendas to be voted on will be chosen among these cards.<br>
After all players have placed their Agenda, they are revealed and the game goes on.</p>
<p><em><strong>Additional rules:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>At any time during this step, players may discard two Political Cards from their hand to draw another Political Card. They may do it as many times as they want.</li>
<li>Instead of placing a card from their hand, players may place the first card of the Political Cards deck, without looking at it.</li>
<li>After all Agendas have been revealed and if there are less than 5 players, reveal additional Political Cards from the deck so that there are 5 revealed Agendas in the Twilight Council area.</li>

<p>Starting with the Speaker and proceeding in the order defined by the Rotation Cycler, each player must pick one of the available Strategy Cards (that was not already picked by another player). She will be able to use it during the upcoming Action Phase.</p>
<p>[Bonus Counter image]<br>
After that, place a <strong>Bonus Counter</strong> on each of the unpicked Strategy Cards. These Bonus Counters stacks from one Round to the next, and increase the value of the Strategy Cards are they are on: When a player picks a Strategy Card, she converts each present Bonus Counter into either a Command Counter or a Trade Goods that she adds to her race sheet.</p>

<p>During the Action Phase, each player will take an Action, that can be either a <a href="#user-content-StrategicAction">Strategic Action</a>, a <a href="#user-content-TacticalAction">Tactical Action</a>, or <a href="#user-content-Passing">Passing</a>. The order in which players can take their Action is given by their <a href="#user-content-Initiative">initiative</a>, the player with the lowest initiative being the first to take an Action.<br>
This sequence is repeated until all players have Passed, at which point the Action Phase ends and the Status Phase begins.</p>
<p><em><strong>Initiative</strong></em> <a name="user-content-Initiative"></a><br>
The <strong>initiative</strong> of a player is the number printed on his Strategy Card.</p>
<p><em><strong>Active Player</strong></em><br>
A player currently taking an Action is called the <strong>active player</strong>.</p>
<p><em><strong>"as an action"</strong></em><br>
Some effects in the game allow players to do things "as an action". This means that using such effects is done instead of taking an Action during the Action Phase.</p>
<h4 id="passing-">
<a id="user-content-passing-" class="anchor" href="#passing-" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Passing <a name="user-content-Passing"></a>
</h4>
<p>A player performs this action when she does not want to perform any other action for the rest of this Action Phase. When it would be the turn of a player that passed, simply skip her. If all players have passed, the Action Phase ends and the <a href="#user-content-StatusPhase">Status Phase</a> starts.<br>
<strong>Important:</strong> A player may not pass before having used her Strategy Card through a Strategic Action.
<strong>Note:</strong> A player that passed may still use the Secondary Abilities of Strategy Cards played after she passed.</p>
<h4 id="strategic-action-">
<a id="user-content-strategic-action-" class="anchor" href="#strategic-action-" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Strategic Action <a name="user-content-StrategicAction"></a>
</h4>
<p>A Strategic Action corresponds to playing a Strategy Card. When a player performs a Strategic Action, she reads and execute for herself the <strong>Primary Ability</strong> of her Strategy Card, then other players, following the order defined by the Rotation Cycler (starting with either the left or right neighbour of the active player, depending on the orientation of the Rotation Cycler), may choose to execute the <strong>Secondary Ability</strong> of the card.<br>
After that the used Strategy Card is flipped on its <em>inactive</em> side, and may not be used again this Round.</p>
<p><em><strong>Important:</strong></em> When performing a Strategic Action, the active player <em>cannot</em> execute the Secondary Ability of the Strategy Card she is playing.</p>
<p><em><strong>Hint:</strong></em> Most of the Secondary Abilities of the Strategy Cards require a Command Counter from Strategy Allocation to be spent in order to be executed. So be sure to keep at least one if you plan on using the Secondary Ability of a given Strategy Card.</p>

<p>Most of the ship movements, planetary conquest and unit production of a game will happen during Tactical Actions.<br>
After declaring a Tactical Action, a player must follow the steps of the <a href="#user-content-ActivationSequence">Activation Sequence</a> described below. With the exception of the first one, each of these steps is only resolved if necessary.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Activation Sequence:</strong></em> <a name="user-content-ActivationSequence"></a></p>
<pre><code>1. System Activation
2. Ships movement
3. Space Cannons Fire (aka PDS Fire)
4. Space Battle
5. Planetary Landings
6. Planetary Landings Resolution (aka Invasion Combat)
7. Production
</code></pre>
<p><em><strong>1) System Activation</strong></em> <a name="user-content-SystemActivation_TacticalActionStep"></a></p>
<p><strong>Activate</strong> a system by placing a Command Counter from the Command Pool area of your Race Sheet ("your Command Pool") in it.<br>
You may not activate a system that already contains one of your Command Counters, but you can activate a system that contains Command Counters from <em>other players</em>.<br>
In fact, as a general rule, you can ignore Command Counters belonging to other players on the galaxy.</p>
<p><em><strong>Important:</strong></em> When rules and effects are referring to <strong>Activated Systems</strong>, they refer to Systems that have been activated by the player they are mentioning.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) Ships movement</strong></em> <a name="user-content-ShipsMovement_TacticalActionStep"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Precised in SA<br>
Note that Space Mines are now placed on borders and not in Systems</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this step, you may move friendly ships <strong>into</strong>, and this is important, only <strong>into the System just activated</strong>. This means that all the ships you are moving must <strong>end their movement in the System just activated</strong> (except if something happens to them on their way, that would stop their movement, like a failed Gravity Rift roll).</p>
<p>The ship movement step can be broken down into 2 main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>a) <a href="#user-content-PlottingTrajectories">Plotting trajectories</a>
</li>
<li>b) <a href="#user-content-ExecutingMovements">Executing movements</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>a) Plotting Trajectories</strong></em> <a name="user-content-PlottingTrajectories"></a></p>
<p>For each friendly ship she wants to move, the active player has to plot a legal trajectory for it. A legal trajectory for a ship is a chain of adjacent systems starting from the System containing the ship and ending in the System just activated, that satisfies the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The starting System was <strong>not activated</strong> by the active player, or is the System that was just previously activated. (e.g. ships may not move out of an activated System, unless it is the System that has been activated during the step 1 of the same Tactical Action)</li>
<li>No System of the trajectory (except the System just activated) contains enemy ships. (e.g. ships may not move through Systems containing enemy ships)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>SA: Unlike in TI3, enemy Fighters do block movement in SA.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The ship must have a sufficient <em>movement value</em> to follow the trajectory. By default, moving from a System to an adjacent System costs 1 movement. For example, a ship with a <em>movement value</em> of 1 can not move further away than 1 system.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Notes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A ship does not need to take the shortest trajectory towards its final destination</li>
<li>Trajectories that start and end in the just activated System without leaving it are allowed, and will result in a movement.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>b) Executing movements</strong></em> <a name="user-content-ExecutingMovements"></a></p>
<p>The active player moves all ships according to their trajectory, in the order of her choice.</p>
<p><em><strong>3) Space Cannons Fire</strong></em> <a name="user-content-SpaceCannonFire_TacticalActionStep"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>New: precise timing about who must take the decision to shoot first: non-active players from Speaker following Rotation Cycler, then active player.
Formerly known as the "PDS Fire" step.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During this step, units with the Space Cannon (<em>n</em>) ability that are in the just activated System may fire at a fleet in the just activated System. There are two possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>a) If the Space Cannon unit <strong>does not belong to the active player</strong>, it can only fire at a fleet <strong>belonging to the active player</strong> in the just activated System. (e.g. it is not possible to allow third party Space Cannon units to fire at an enemy fleet by activating it)</li>
<li>b) If the Space Cannon unit <strong>belongs to the active player</strong>, it can fire at <strong>any</strong> fleet in the just activated System.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A potential problem with the wording above is that it allows the active player to fire her Space Cannon units at her own fleet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Starting with the Speaker and following the Rotation Cycler, the non-active players may in turn shoot with their Space Cannon units. Then it is the turn of the active player.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The above wording could use the term Rotation Order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a Space Cannon (<em>n</em>) unit fires, it performs <em>n</em> combat rolls. Hits must be attributed to the targeted fleet.</p>
<p><em><strong>4) Space Battles</strong></em> <a name="user-content-SpaceBattles_TacticalActionStep"></a></p>
<p>At this time, if there are ships controlled by two different players in the just activated System, a Space Battle must be resolved.<br>
In this Space Battle, the active player is the <em>attacker</em>, while the other player is the <em>defender</em>. For complete rules about how to resolve a Space Battle, see the <a href="#user-content-SpaceBattles">Space Battles section</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>5) Planetary Landings</strong></em> <a name="user-content-PlanetaryLandings_TacticalActionStep"></a></p>
<p>The Planetary Landings step is divided in two parts: the lanetary landings themselves, and the Bombardment assignment.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Planetary landings</strong>: The active player may land troops, PDSs and Leaders currently carried by his ships in the just activated System on planets in the same System. PDSs and Leaders landing on non-friendly planets must be accompanied by at least one troop.</li>
<li>
<strong>Bombardment assignment</strong>: The active player may assign some of his ships in the just activated System with the <em>Bombardment</em> ability to the non-friendly planets of this System, in order to be able to bombard them during the 6) Planetary Landing resolution step.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>6) Planetary Landings resolution</strong></em> <a name="user-content-PlanetaryLandingsResolution_TacticalActionStep"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Formerly known as the "Invasion Combat" step.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Until all planets that had units or Leaders landed on them or ships assigned to bombard them in the just activated System have been resolved, the active player chooses an unresolved planet and resolves it according to the following:
(In what follows, "landed" troops, PDSs and Leaders refer to the troops, PDSs and Leaders that were landed on the planet being resolved)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could be cool to have "friendly", "neutral" and "hostile" in colour, but I did not find how to do it yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>a) The planet is <strong>friendly</strong>:<br>
Place the landed troops, PDSs and Leaders on the planet. No bombardment occur.</li>
<li>b) The planet is <strong>neutral</strong>:<br>
The active player must resolve the Domain Counters present on the planet (if there is any), in the order defined in the <a href="#user-content-DomainCounters">Domain Counters section</a>. No bombardment occur (unless included in an Invasion Combat triggered by a Domain Counter). If there are still landed troops after resolving the Domain Counters, place all landed units and Leaders on the planet and the active player takes control of it, exhausted; else, destroy all landed PDSs and make a Fate Roll for each landed Leader.</li>
<li>c) The planet is <strong>controlled by an opponent</strong>:
<ul>
<li>c-1) The planet <strong>contains at least one enemy troop or PDS</strong>:<br>
If you landed at least one troop, resolve an <a href="#user-content-InvasionCombats">Invasion Combat</a> on this planet, else the ships assigned to this planet <a href="#user-content-Bombardment_unitAbility">bombard</a> it without an Invasion Combat taking place.</li>
<li>c-2) The planet <strong>does not contain any enemy troop and PDS</strong>:<br>
The ships assigned to this planet <a href="#user-content-Bombardment_unitAbility">bombard</a> it. Then place all landed troop, PDSs and Leaders on the planet and the active player takes control of it, exhausted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>7) Production</strong></em> <a name="user-content-Production_TacticalActionStep"></a>
Note: All the resources that the active player decides to spend during this step may be added up and spent at once at the end of the step. The total amount of resources that must be spend is rounded up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ditched the "at least one Cruiser -&gt; at most 2 Space Mines". Let's be modular. Each unit with the Deploy Space Mines (<em>n</em>) ability may deploy up to <em>n</em> Space Mines.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Deploy Space Mines</strong>:<br>
See the <a href="#user-content-DeploySpaceMines_unitAbility">Deploy Space Mines</a> ability.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a problem with the Arborec racial that gives them production capacity for their Ground Forces. As it currently stands, their <em>planets</em> get the production capacity, which just does not work well with the Space Dock-centric production model of this rulebook. I could define planets with production capacity, but that would be a lengthy rule (to clarify what happens when there is a Space Dock on the same planet, and what happens when this Space Dock cannot produce units for some reason) for a single use-case. So I think that it would be the job of the text of the racial ability to clarify these issues itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Produce units</strong>:<br>
The active player may produce units at each of her units with the <a href="#user-content-ProduceUnits_unitAbility">Produce Units (<em>n</em>) ability</a> in the just activated Systems, with a <em>production capacity</em> of <em>n</em>. In most cases, units will be produced by <strong>unexhausted</strong> Space Docks, that have as many <em>production capacity</em> as the resource value of the planet they are on plus two.</li>
<li>
<strong>Build Space Docks</strong>:<br>
The active player may build Space Docks on some of the planets in the just activated System. A Space Dock may only be built on a planet that she has controlled since the beginning of the Round, and that does not already have a Space Dock. Newly built Space Docks are placed <strong>exhausted</strong> (flipped) and may thus not produce units until they are refreshed (usually during the Status Phase).</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Producing units</strong></em><br>
When producing units, any combination of units may be produced provided the following four limitations are respected and it can be placed in the System (see <a href="#user-content-PlacingProducedUnits">placing produced units</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Production Capacity</strong>: Each unit has a production capacity cost, the total production capacity cost of the produced units may not exceed the production capacity of the unit producing them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fleet Supply</strong>: Be careful that if you violate your <a href="#user-content-FleetSupply">Fleet Supply limit</a> in the System, you will have to scuttle some ships.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fighter Capacity</strong>: The System must have a sufficient <a href="#user-content-Capacity_unitAbility">Fighter Capacity</a> to support the produced Fighters.</li>
<li>
<strong>Resource Cost</strong>: Each unit has a resource cost. The player producing units must spend the required amount of resources.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Placing produced units</strong></em> <a name="user-content-PlacingProducedUnits"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>New: placement of troops and PDSs produced by units in space</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After units have been produced, they must be placed according to the following rules. The <em>producer</em> refers to the unit that produced them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ships are placed in the space of the System containing the <em>producer</em>
</li>
<li>If the <em>producer</em> is on a planet, then all produced troops and PDSs must be placed on the planet. Else, they may be distributed in the System among friendly planets and friendly units with sufficient <a href="#user-content-Capacity_unitAbility">capacity</a> to carry them.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Blockade</strong></em><br>
No ships may be produced in a System already containing enemy ships.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I excluded the "Pay upkeep for Fleet Supply &gt; 8" step from the Status Phase sequence. It does not have enough effects in normal games to justify its word count and learning time. It could become part of a set of optional rules related to epic games with huge maps and high Victory Point goal.<br>
Made slight changes to the names of the step to better reflect their content<br>
Added a "Take back Agendas" step, where players have to take back their Agendas (the Political Cards they put in the Twilight Council zone during the Strategy Phase), if these agendas have not been voted on or discarded. Else, people would frequently just leave their Agenda in place face-up because they do not care, giving away precious informations to the opponents.<br>
Added a "Scuttling" step near the end of the sequence.
After the Strategy Phase and the Action Phase comes the Status Phase. During this phase, players claim objectives granting them Victory Points, unlock Racial Improvements, and "clean up the table" for the next Round.</p>

</ol>
<p><em><strong>1) Claim Objectives</strong></em> <a name="user-content-ClaimObjectives_StatusPhaseStep"></a></p>
<p>Starting with the Speaker and following the Rotation Cycler, players may claim objectives to gain Victory points, eventually allowing them to win the game.</p>
<p><strong>Claiming an Objective</strong><br>
In order to claim an objective, a player must satisfy the requirements written on it, and not have already claimed it in the past (whether other players have already claimed it or not does not matter). The player then places a flag on the objective, and advances her flag on the Victory Point Track by the number of Victory Points granted by the objective.</p>
<p><strong>Claiming Limit</strong><br>
During a Claim Objective step, a player:</p>
<ul>
<li>May claim:
<ul>
<li>At most 1 revealed Public Objective (either from Stage 1 or <a href="#user-content-Stage2PublicObjectives">Stage 2</a> (Stage 2 Objectives may only be claimed if Stage 2 has been initiated))</li>
<li>At most 1 <a href="#user-content-SecretObjectives">Secret Objective</a> from her hand</li>
<li>The <a href="#user-content-PreliminaryObjectives">Preliminary Objective</a> (if it is still claimable)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Must claim:
<ul>
<li>All <a href="#user-content-SpecialObjectives">Special Objectives</a> she qualifies for</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stage 2 Public Objectives (Blue)</strong> <a name="user-content-Stage2PublicObjectives"></a><br>
Stage 2 Public Objectives are harder Objectives that grant more Victory Points than Stage 1 ones. However, a player may only claim a Stage 2 Public Objective if the number of revealed Stage 1 Public Objectives is equal or higher to the Victory Point goal of the game (10 by default).</p>
<p><strong>Preliminary Objectives (Grey)</strong> <a name="user-content-PreliminaryObjectives"></a>
At the end of a Round in which a Preliminary Objective has been claimed by at least one player, it becomes unclaimable by all other players for the rest of the game. This creates a race among players to score them as early as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Secret Objectives (Red)</strong> <a name="user-content-SecretObjectives"></a><br>
When claiming a Secret Objective, a player must reveal it and show she indeed meets its requirements. If she does not meet them, the Secret Objective is discarded.</p>
<p><strong>Special Objectives (Green)</strong><a name="user-content-SpecialObjectives"><br>
There are three kinds of Special Objectives:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>The Artifact Objectives</em> award Victory Points to the players controlling some of the four <a href="#user-content-Artifact">Artifacts</a>.</li>
<li>
<em>Sovereign and Imperial</em> award Victory Points to the players controlling more than 8 and 12 planets outside their <a href="#user-content-HomeSystems">Home Systems</a> respectively.</li>
<li>
<em>Voice of the Council</em> awards a Victory Point to the player that was elected <a href="#user-content-VoiceOfTheCouncil">Voice of the Council</a> during the <a href="#user-content-GameConcepts_TwilightCouncil">Twilight Council</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Special Objectives differ from the other kinds of objective in that if a player that has claimed one of them stop meeting its requirements, her claim on the Special Objective is lost <strong>instantly</strong>: she must remove her flag from the objective card and loses the associated Victory Points <strong>immediately</strong>. This does not prevent her from claiming this objective again later in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Winning the game</strong><br>
After all players have finished claiming objectives, if at least one of them has the required amount of Victory Point (or more) that was decided at the start of the game, the game ends.<br>
Whoever has the most Victory Points at that time is declared winner. If two or more players have the same number of Victory Points, ties are broken in favour of the one controlling the most planets outside of his Home System. If there is still a tie, tied players share the victory.</p>
<pre><code>She has gained the power needed to claim the for too long empty Imperial Throne on Mecatol Rex. The Winnaran Custodians will step aside for their new Empress, who must lead the galaxy to a new age of prosperity, peace and enlightenment.
</code></pre>
<p>Note that it is possible for a player to win the game outside of the Status Phase (some effects grant Victory Points during the Action Phase). If a player reaches the required amount of Victory Point at any time outside of the Status Phase, the game ends immediately and a victor is determined following the same procedure as above.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) Progression Feedback to Victory Point Leader</strong></em> <a name="user-content-ProgressionFeedback_StatusPhaseStep"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>New in SA</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The player with the most Victory Points gains as many Trade Goods as his Victory Point lead over the player with the second-most Victory Points.</p>
<p><em><strong>3) Unlock Racial Improvements</strong></em> <a name="user-content-UnlockRacialImprovements_StatusPhaseStep"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>New in SA<br>
Replaces "Racial Technology" with "Racial Improvement" to reduce the confusion, since the "Racial Technology" from the vanilla TI3 are actually not considered "Technologies" at all in SA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Starting with the Speaker and following the Rotation Cycler, each player may now unlock some of his <a href="#user-content-RacialImprovements">Racial Improvements</a> by spending resources.</p>
<p>The cost of unlocking a Racial Improvement is computed as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Base cost (printed on the card) - Victory Points (owned by the player) + Base costs of the other Racial Improvements the player has already unlocked 
</code></pre>
<p>Multiple Racial Improvements can be unlocked at the same time, but they must be unlocked one after the other.</p>
<p><em><strong>4) Produce Trade Goods (2:1)</strong></em> <a name="user-content-ProduceTradeGoods_StatusPhaseStep"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>New in SA</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Starting with the Speaker and following the Rotation Cycler, each player may spend resources to receive one Trade Good for each two resources spent.</p>
<p><em><strong>5) Refresh Planets</strong></em> <a name="user-content-RefreshPlanets_StatusPhaseStep"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>New in SA: Facilities are built at this step rather than during Tactical Action.<br>
Change: Refresh abilities are used by not refreshing the planet, instead of requiring the exhaustion of the planet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Starting with the Speaker, and following the Rotation Cycler, each player refreshes his planets, by turning the corresponding planet cards upright.<br>
Instead of refreshing a planet at this step, players may either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a <a href="#user-content-Facility">Facility</a> on the planet, provided it does not already have one.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="#user-content-RefreshAbility">refresh ability</a> of the planet, if it has one.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> "Instead of refreshing" means that the planet stays in the state it was in before this step. So for example, a refreshed planet on which a Facility is built stays refreshed.</p>
<p><em><strong>6) Receive 1 Action Card, 1 Political Card and 2 Command Counters</strong></em> <a name="user-content-ReceiveCardsAndCCs_StatusPhaseStep"></a></p>

<p>Starting with the Speaker and following the Rotation Cycler, players may scuttle some of their units on the board by placing them in <a href="#user-content-Reinforcements">reinforcements</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>10) Remove Command Counters from the board, return Strategy Cards, repair units, refresh Space Docks</strong></em> <a name="user-content-CleanUp_StatusPhaseStep"></a></p>

<p><strong>Assigning a hit</strong> <a name="user-content-AssigningAHit"></a>:<br>
When her opponent generates a <em>hit</em> during a Space Battle or Invasion Combat, a player must assign it to one of her units involved in the SpaceBattle/InvasionCombat (she chooses which unit). Each unit may only be assigned at most one <em>hit</em>, and doing so destroys the unit.</p>
<p><strong>End of a Space Battle</strong>:<br>
If before a Combat Round would begin, either the attacker or the defender does not have ships in the System of the Space Battle, the Space Battle ends. If one player still has ships in the System at this point, she is declared the <strong>winner</strong> of the Space Battle.</p>

<p>This section details how to resolve Invasion Combats. Invasion Combats are fights on planets, that occur when, during the Planetary Landing step of a Tactical Action, the active player lands troops on an enemy planet that contains troops and/or PDSs. The player that landed troops is the <em>attacker</em>, the other player is the <em>defender</em>.</p>
<p>Like Space Battles, Invasion Combats consist of a <em>Pre-Combat</em> phase, followed by a succession of <em>Combat Rounds</em> that continues as long as both players have troops on the planet the Invasion Combat takes place on.</p>

<p><strong>End of an Invasion Combat</strong>:<br>
If before a Combat Round would begin, either the attacker or the defender does not have troops on the planet the Invasion Combat is taking place, the Invasion Combat ends:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the attacker still has troops on the planet at this point, she wins the Invasion Combat.

</h2>
<p>[image of a Command Counter, with both sides]</p>
<p>Each player has a number of Command Counters. They are used for various purposes, which this section will explain. During the game, Command Counters can exist either in a player's reinforcements, on one of three dedicated zones of his race sheet, or in systems of the galaxy.</p>
<p>Whenever a player receives or gain a Command Counter, he must place it on his race sheets in one of the three following areas (she chooses which):</p>
<ul>
<li>Command Pool</li>
<li>Fleet Supply</li>
<li>Strategy Allocation</li>
</ul>
<p>Command Counters may not be moved from one area to another, except during the  <a href="#user-content-ReallocateCommandCounters_StatusPhaseStep">Reallocate Command Counters step</a>  of the Status Phase.</p>
<h3 id="command-pool-">
<a id="user-content-command-pool-" class="anchor" href="#command-pool-" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Command Pool <a name="user-content-CommandPool"></a>
</h3>
<p>The Command Counters in the Command Pool are used to perform Tactical Actions. If a player does not have any Command Counter in her Command Pool, she may not perform Tactical Actions.</p>
<h3 id="fleet-supply-">
<a id="user-content-fleet-supply-" class="anchor" href="#fleet-supply-" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fleet Supply <a name="user-content-FleetSupply"></a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I changed the part about how to handle Fleet Supply excess. Instead of having both:</p>
<ul>
<li>"A player may never move units, build units, or otherwise acquire units in any system so that the number of ships herein (again, excluding Fighters) exceed the number of Command Counters in his Fleet Supply area. "</li>
<li>AND</li>
<li>"If, for any reason, the number of ships in a system should exceed the number of Command Counters in a player's Fleet Supply, the owner of those ships must immediately remove enough ships from the system (by placing them back with his reinforcements) until the number of ships is again in compliance with the number of Command Counters in his Fleet Supply area. "<br>
I said that you must destroy the ships that were added last and caused the Fleet Supply excess.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Command Counters placed in Fleet Supply must be placed with the "fleet" side up.<br>
The number of Command Counters in a player's Fleet Supply is her <strong>Fleet Supply</strong>: the maximum number of non-Fighter ships she may have in any System at any time.</p>
<p>If a player has more non-Fighter ships in a System than her Fleet Supply the ships that were added last and caused the violation must be immediately scuttled. For example, if a player has a Fleet Supply of 2, and moves a non-Fighter ship into a System where she already has two non-Fighter ship, she must destroy the ship she just moved (she may not destroy one of the ships that were already in the System).</p>
<p>The Fleet Supply constraints is <em>not</em> checked while ships are moving, but is checked right after all ships have finished their movement.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the <strong>Fleet Supply</strong> is a constraint on the number of non-Fighter ship of fleets, not on the number of fleets. For example, a player with 3 Fleet Supply may have as many fleets as she wants (up to one per System!), but none of these fleets may have more than 3 non-Fighter ships.</p>

<p>Cut the unnecessary (in my opinion) "You can't play two Action Cards of the same name at the same situation/unit".<br>
Removed the "If a player at 7 cards is about to draw additional cards, he should draw and discard one Action Card at a time. ". Just draw your cards and then discard until the limit is satisfied.<br>
Removed the "Action Card effects that are normally restricted from being used in Home Systems can still be used if granted permission by the system's original owner." because the same effect can be achieved by tweaking a few ACs wordings instead of adding an additional general rule.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[image]<br>
Throughout the game, players will come into possessions of Action Cards that they will add to their hand.</p>
<p><em><strong>Key Points:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Timing:</strong> Each Action Card has a specified timing at which it can be played, indicating by the "Play:" label.</li>
<li>
<strong>"As an Action":</strong> Action Cards with the "As an action" timing are played instead of taking an action.</li>
<li>
<strong>Secret:</strong> Players may not show their Action Cards to others.</li>
<li>
<strong>Hand limit:</strong> A player may not have more than 7 Action Cards in her hand. If she would exceed this limit by drawing Action Cards, she first draws all her Action Cards, and then discard Action Cards from her hand until she has 7.</li>
<li>
<strong>Home Systems:</strong> The text of some Action Cards mention that the card cannot be played, or has no effects, in Home Systems.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sabotage:</strong> When an Action Card is revealed by a player, but before it starts being resolved, it can be <em>sabotaged</em> by some effects. <em>Sabotaged</em> Action Cards are discarded instead of being resolved and the game resumes as if they had not been played. In particular, playing an "as an Action" Action Card that gets <em>sabotaged</em> does not take an Action.</li>
<li>
<strong>Effect Location:</strong> Each Action Card has a specified effect location, indicating in which System of the galaxy it is played. This information is used by <a href="#user-content-Agent">Agents</a>.</li>

<p><strong>Agenda</strong><br>
Refers to the Political Cards that were placed in the Twilight Council zone during the Strategy Phase.</p>
<p>The Twilight Council concurs as part of the Assembly (3) Strategy Card Primary Ability.<br>
During this Primary Ability, the active player must choose a number of agendas to be voted on (see the Strategy Card), and select the order in which they will be resolved after being voted on.</p>
<h3 id="voting">
<a id="user-content-voting" class="anchor" href="#voting" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Voting</h3>
<ol>
<li>Each player calculates how many votes she has, by summing the influence values of all her <em>unexhausted</em> planets and potentially adding bonus votes granted by other effects.
If a player would have 0 votes, she gets 1 vote.</li>
<li>Players debate, threaten, lure, bribe or convince each other. Remember that no promises are binding.</li>
<li>Players take a piece of paper and a pen, and secretly write their votes. They must split their votes between the agendas and may not vote for two different outcomes of the same agenda, but they are not required to use all of their votes.<br>
For example, in order to place 3 votes on the FOR outcome of an agenda, a player would write: "NameOfTheAgenda: For 3" on his sheet.</li>
<li>All vote sheets are collected and votes are tallied. Then the agendas are resolved according to the outcome that got the more votes.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Ties</strong></em><br>
If multiple outcomes of the same agenda receive the same number of votes, the tie is broken by the <a href="#user-content-Speaker">Speaker</a>.<br>

Political Cards with the "elect" keywords ask the player to elect someone or something (depending on the card). The subject getting the most votes will be elected.</p>
<p><em><strong>"For or Against"</strong></em><br>
Political Cards with the "For or Against" keyword have only two outcomes: <em>For</em> and <em>Against</em>. The outcome receiving the more votes will be resolved.</p>
<p><em><strong>"Law"</strong></em><br>
Political Cards with the "Law" keyword represent permanent changes and will stay active after they were voted on.<br>

<p>[image]<br>
After the agendas being voted on have been designated and their resolution order has been chosen, any player may spend 1 Command Counter from Strategy Allocation to include the Voice of the Council Special Objective to the agendas being voted on.<br>
Voice of the Council is treated as a Law with the "elect player" keyword <em>for the duration of the vote</em> (it stops being considered as a Political Card after it). The player including it chooses where it is placed in the resolution order.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Technologies represent scientific advances the players can acquire (research) throughout the game to strengthen the potential of their race. Technologies are presented in a Technology Tree and can be of one of these four colors, corresponding to four technological domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red: Warfare technologies</li>

<p><em><strong>Acquisition</strong></em><br>
Technologies are mostly acquired through the use of the Technology Strategy Card. When a player acquires a Technology, she places one of her flags on the corresponding Technology on the Technology Tree and benefit from its effects.</p>
<p><em><strong>Prerequisites</strong></em><br>
Some Technologies have other Technologies as prerequisites. This is indicated on the Technology Tree by lines: when two Technologies are connected by a line, the topmost Technology is a prerequisite of the other one. A player cannot acquire a Technology that has prerequisites without having acquired at least one of its prerequisites.<br>
Exception: When a '+' symbol in a red circle is present, both prerequisites are required.</p>
<p><em><strong>Purchases and Discounts</strong></em><br>
Some effects allow players to "purchase" Technology for a given resource price. This simply means the player may pay the required amount of resources to acquire a Technology.<br>
This cost is reduced by 1 if the player controls the <a href="#user-content-ArtifactTechnologyDiscounts">Artefact</a> of the same color than the purchased Technology, and by 1 for each <a href="#user-content-TechnologySpecialty">Technology Specialy</a> of the same color than the purchased Technology present on <em>refreshed</em> planets the player controls.</p>

<p>When a player receives Trade Goods, she places them into the Trade Good Area of her race sheet.

For example if she wants to spend five resources, she can exhaust Planets for three resources and spend two Trade Goods.<br>
Spent Trade Goods are returned to the common play area.</p>
<p>Players are allowed to give other players Trade Goods from their Trade Good Area at any time. This makes the Trade Goods counter a flexible currency with which to bribe, pay, or assist other players economically.</p>

<a id="user-content-breaking-trade-agreements" class="anchor" href="#breaking-trade-agreements" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Breaking Trade Agreements</h3>
<p>There are multiple ways a Trade Agreement can be broken. The most common ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any player involved in a Trade Agreement may unilaterally break it during the <a href="#user-content-Scuttling_StatusPhaseStep">Scuttling and Breaking Trade Agreements</a> step of the Status Phase.</li>
<li>At the end of an action during which a player performed a <a href="#user-content-HostileAction">hostile action</a> against another, any Trade Agreements between these two players are broken.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a Trade Agreement is broken, the two players automatically collect a certain part of the Trade Goods present on their Trade Agreement (the other Trade Goods are discarded), then they flip the cards so that the Trade Agreement sides face the table and finally give the card back to their former trade partner.</p>
<p>The part of Trade Goods that get collected depends on how the Trade Agreement was broken:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it was broken due to a <a href="#user-content-HostileAction">hostile action</a>, the player that performed the hostile action collects none of the Trade Goods on her Trade Agreements, while her trade partner collects all the Trade Goods on her Trade Agreement.</li>
<li>If it was broken for any other reason, both players collect half (round down) of the Trade Goods on their Trade Agreement.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Let us assume Letnev and Sol have opened a Trade Agreement. Letnev gave Sol one of his Trade Contract (value: 1), while Sol did the same (value: 2). So at this stage, Letnev has in its playing zone one of Sol's Trade Contracts with the Trade Agreement side face-up (showing the value of 2), while Sol has one of Letnev's Trade Contracts (showing the value of 1). Saying the same thing in a different way: Letnev has one of Sol's Trade Contract as Trade Agreement, and Sol has one of Letnev's Trade Contract as Trade Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let us assume that an effect placed Trade Goods on the Trade Agreements. So there are 2 Trade Goods on Letnev's Trade Agreement (Sol's Trade Contract in Letnev's playing zone), and 1 Trade Good on Sol's Trade Agreement (Letnev's Trade Contract in Sol's playing zone).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Letnev uses an effect allowing it to collect the Trade Goods on its Trade Agreements at this point, it would gain the 2 Trade Goods present on Sol's Trade Contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this Trade Agreement gets broken because Sol performed a hostile action against Letnev, Letnev would gain the all the Trade Goods on its Trade Agreement (2), while Sol would gain nothing and discard the Trade Good on its Trade Agreement. They would then exchange back the Trade Contracts and flip them (so the Trade Agreement side faces the table).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this Trade Agreement gets broken for another reason, Letnev would gain half round down of the Trade Goods on its Trade Agreement (1), while Sol would also gain half round down of the Trade Goods on its Trade Agreement (0).</p>
