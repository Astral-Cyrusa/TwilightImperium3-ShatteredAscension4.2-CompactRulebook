# Shattered Ascension Compact Rulebook  - v6_2017-03-14

#### Notes
***Contradictions***  
If the text of a component (card, technology,...) would contradict with the rules presented in this rulebook, the component takes precedence.

***Compliance***  
A player subject to negative effects (for example discard *3* Trade Goods) must fulfil them as far as able (if she only has *2* Trade Goods, she must discard them).

## Overview
<!---
### Game Overview
-->
In a game of Twilight Imperium, 2 to 8 players take the role of varied great races fighting for supremacy in the galaxy after the ruling Lazax Empire has fallen. The game is played over several Rounds, during which players strive to fulfil Objectives in order to score Victory Points. The first player to reach a predetermined number of Victory Points is declared the winner and the new Empress of the Galaxy.

<!---	
### Goal of the Game (Overview)
A game of Shattered Ascension is a succession of Rounds. At the end of each Round, players can acquire Victory Points by claiming various Objectives. If a player ends a Round with at least as many Victory Points as the limit that was decided at the beginning of the game (usually 10), she is declared winner.

<a name="Setup_BuildingTheGalaxy">
**1) Building the Galaxy**
</a>

> I put the creation of a pre set map before everything else, because then you can set it up in advance, and it's how we do it in TTS, and it works better. 

Choose either:
 
* Choose and build a pre-set map from [Shattered Ascension Map Database](http://www.astralvault.net/games/SA/maps.html)
* Decide to have the player build the map following the [Star by Star procedure](#StarByStar). In this case, the map will be built at step 6.

<a name="Setup_TableSetup">
**2) Table Setup**  
</a> 

> Again, this step is at the top, because it doesn't require cerebral activity and can be done in advance.

Find an area of the table that is convenient for all players to reach. Designate this 
space the *common play area*, and populate it with the following:

* Action Cards deck
* Polical Cards deck
* Ground Force and Fighter tokens
* Trade Goods tokens
* Planet Cards deck
* The Strategy Cards from number 1 to 8. Add in the 9th if there are 4, 7 or 8 players.
* The Objective deck: all the Stage I Objective Cards.
* The Special Objective Cards
* The Victory Point track

Inside this common play area, designate a space that will be used as the *Twilight Council*.  

<a name="Setup_VictoryPointGoal">
**3) Victory Point Goal**  
</a> 

Decide on the number of Victory Points required to win. The recommanded values are:

* 8 Victory Points for duels
* 10 Victory Points for normal games
* 14 Victory Points for epic (long) games

<a name="Setup_GameOptions">
**4) Game Options**  
</a>
> Twilight Council is no more an option, it is part of SA.

Decide on the game options to include:

* [Path of Fate](#PathOfFate) (Race-Specific Objectives)
* [Simultaneous Action System](#SimultaneousActionSystem)
* [Ascendancy](#Ascendancy) (essentially doubles the Victory Point goal and makes objectives claimable multiple times)

<a name="Setup_SecretObjectives">
**5) Secret Objectives**  
</a>

If this game is not a duel, deal two Secret Objective cards to each player. They will have to discard one of them later.

<a name="Setup_RacePicking">
**6) Race Picking** 
</a>

> For the race picking and biddings, the SA patchrule starts with either the highest or lowest rolling player and go either clockwise or counter clockwise, but since we use the rolling order in TTS, I thought I may as well write the rule for it.

* Have each player roll a die. Remember the results, as they will be used in the following setup steps as well.
*  Starting with the highest rolling player in **decreasing rolling order**, each player may either choose any availlable race to command or pass. The unchosen races form the pool of random races.
*  All players without a race are **secretly** dealt a random race from the pool. They may either keep it, or reshuffle it into the pool (without revealing them).
*  Conduct the above step a second time.
*  All player without a race are **publicly** dealt a random race from the pool, that they must play for this game.

<a name="Setup_HSLocationBiddingORGalaxyBuilding">
**7) Home System Location Bidding OR Galaxy Building**
</a>

*Note: The Trade Goods that are bid at this step are taken from the reserve, not from the players.*

If you chose a pre-set map, then players will now bid on the Home System location they wish to start on.  
The highest rolling player places a race flag (or another item if her race is not public) along with a bid of Trade Goods on any Home System Location.
Then in **decreasing rolling order** (looping), each player either places a bid on a new Home System or overbid another. This continues until all players have a Home System location (skipping the turn of players who already have a Home System location).
All players add as many Trade Goods as the difference between the highest bid and their own bid to their starting Trade Goods.

If you chose to build the map using the [Star by Star procedure](#StarByStar), now is the time to do it.

*Players may now change seat in order to be aligned with their Home System location.*

<a name="Setup_SpeakerTokenBidding">
**8) Speaker Token Bidding**
</a>

*Note: The Trade Goods that are bid at this step are taken from the reserve, not from the players.*

The lowest rolling player places a bid of Trade Goods (may be 0) on the Speaker Token. Then in **increasing rolling order** (looping), each player may either withdraw from the bidding or overbid. The winner is assigned the Speaker Token/ The other players add as many Trade Goods as the winning bid to their starting Trade Goods.

<a name="Setup_StartingTradeGoodsNormalisation">
**9) Starting Trade Goods Normalisation**
</a>

All players now add or subtract the same number of Trade Goods such that the player with the lowest amount starts out with 1 Trade Good.

<a name="Setup_OrientingTheRotationCycler">
**10) Orienting the Rotation Cycler**
</a>
> This thing has its own step, that is placed AFTER the TG normalisation step, because we don't want potential TG transactions to affect the TG Normalisation. 

The player holding the Speaker Token may now set the orientation of the Rotation Cycler.

<a name="Setup_DeckBuiding">
**11) Deck Building**
</a>
 
* Build the objective deck by shuffling all the Stage I Public Objective cards.
* Shuffle the Action Cards and Political Cards decks

<a name="Setup_RevealingObjectives">
**12) Revealing Objectives**
</a>

Reveal:

* All Special Objectives (if playing a duel, exclude Sovereign and Magisterial)
* 3 random Stage I Public Objectives
* 1 random Preliminary Objective (not if playing a duel)
* 3 random Stage II Public Objectives

<a name="Setup_FinalisingSetup">
**13) Finalising Setup**
</a>

* Each player discards a Secret Objective (the discard pile of Secret Objectives cards is NOT public)
* Each player draws 2 Political Cards
* Reveal hidden races
* Each player chooses a set of plastic miniatures and takes her race's Command Counters. She places them near her race sheet. They will form her "Reinforcements".
> * I think that "Flag" is a better name than "Control Marker". It's more visual. And we say "flag" when we talk anyway.
> * Let's forget about the dual name "Trade Contract"-"Trade Agreement", and just call these cards "Trade Agreements", that may be either "active" or "inactive".
> * "Race-Specific Technology" -> "Racial Improvement", to show that they are really not like normal technologies.
> * "Promissory Notes" do not exist in SA.

* Each player takes the assets of her race:
	* Flags
	* Flagship card
	* Trade Agreement cards
	* Racial Improvement cards
* Each player places a Flag on the zero of the Victory Point Track.
* Each player places Flags on the technology tree, besides her starting technologies (indicated on her race sheet).

> "Installations" = PDSs and SpaceDocks

* Each player places her starting units and Leaders (indicated on her race sheet) in her Home System. Ground units and Installations may be placed on any planet. Leaders may be placed on any ships or planet.
* Each players places Command Counters from her reinforcements onto her race sheet as follows:
	* 2 in Strategy Allocation (with the race's symbol side up)
	* 3 in Command Pool (with the race's symbol side up)
	* 3 in Fleet Supply (with the ship silhouette side up)

**14) Play!**

Start the first Round.

## The Game Round

Shattered Ascension is played over a consecutive number of Rounds. Each Round is split into three phases: The [Strategy Phase](#StrategyPhase) where player place a Political Card in the Twilight Council and select their Strategy Card for the Round, the [Action Phase](#ActionPhase), where players use their Strategy Cards, move their ships, conquer planets and build units, and the [Status Phase](#StatusPhase), where the board is cleaned up and players can gain Victory Points by claiming Objectives. If no player is declared winner at the end of a Round, another Round starts.

<a name="StrategyPhase">
### Strategy Phase
</a>
The Strategy Phase is divided into three steps:  

* [Home System Planets Reclamation](#HomeSystemPlanetsReclamation)
* [Twilight Council Propositions](#TwiligthCouncilPropositions)
* [Strategy Card Picking](#StrategyCardPicking)


<a name="HomeSystemPlanetsReclamation">
#### Home System Planets Reclamation
</a>
> New in SA  

During this step, players regain control of any planet that is in their Home System, does not contain any troop, and is not already under their control. These planet are acquired exhausted.

<a name="TwilightCouncilPropositions">
#### Twilight Council Propositions
</a>
> New in SA  

During this step, players will place or update their Political Card in the Twilight Council. If the Twilight Council concur this round, the agendas to be voted on will be chosen among these cards.

* Players that already have a Political Card in the Twilight Council must retake it into their hand.
* Players may, as many times as they want, discard two Political Cards from their hand to draw another Political Card.
* Then each player must place a hidden Political Card from their hand into the Twilight Council, and place one of their flag on it.  
Instead of a card from their hand, they can place the first card of the Political Card deck, without looking at it.
* Finally, when all players have done so, reveal all Political Cards in the Twilight Council.

<a name="StrategyCardPicking">
#### Strategy Card Picking
</a>
Starting with the Speaker and proceeding in the order defined by the Rotation Cycler, each player must pick one of the available Strategy Cards (that was not already picked by another player). She will be able to use it during the upcoming Action Phase.

<!-- LINK for Bonus Counter -->  
After that, place a **Bonus Counter** on each of the unpicked Strategy Cards. These Bonus Counters stacks from one Round to the next, and increase the value of the Strategy Cards are they are on: When a player picks a Strategy Card, she converts each present Bonus Counter into either a Command Counter or a Trade Goods that she adds to her race sheet.

<a name="ActionPhase">
### Action Phase
</a>
During the Action Phase, players will take Turns in the [Initiative Order](#InitiativeOrder) (see below). At her Turn, a player must perform one Action, which can be either a [Strategic Action](#StrategicAction), a [Tactical Action](#TacticalAction), or [Passing](#Passing).  Once a player has taken an Action, her Turn ends and the Turn of the next player in the [Initiative Order](#InitiativeOrder) starts. Players that have not yet passed will keep taking turns, until all of them have Passed and the Action Phase ends.

A player currently in the process of taking her turn (i.e. performing an Action) is called the **active player**.

<a name="InitiativeOrder">
***Initiative Order:*** </a>  
Each Strategy Card has an initiative number printed on it. The **initiative** of each player is the initiative number of her Strategy Card. The Initiative Order simply orders players from lowest to highest initiative.

***"as an action":***  
Some effects in the game allow players to do things "as an action". This means that using such effects uses up a Turn and is done instead of another Action.

<a name="Passing">
#### Passing
</a>
A player performs this action when she does not want to perform any other action for the rest of this Action Phase. When it would be the turn of a player that passed, simply skip her. If all players have passed, the Action Phase ends and the [Status Phase](#StatusPhase) starts.  
**Important:** A player may not pass before having used her Strategy Card through a Strategic Action.

<a name="StrategicAction">
#### Strategic Action
</a>
A Strategic Action corresponds to playing a Strategy Card. When a player performs a Strategic Action, she reads and execute for herself the **Primary Ability** of her Strategy Card, then other players, following the order defined by the Rotation Cycler (starting with either the left or right neighbour of the active player, depending on the orientation of the Rotation Cycler), may choose to execute the **Secondary Ability** of the card.  
After that the used Strategy Card is flipped on its *inactive* side, and may not be used again this Round. 

***Important:*** When performing a Strategic Action, the active player *cannot* execute the Secondary Ability of the Strategy Card she is playing.

***Hint:*** Most of the Secondary Abilities of the Strategy Cards require a Command Counter from Strategy Allocation to be spent in order to be executed. So be sure to keep at least one if you plan on using the Secondary Ability of a given Strategy Card. 

<a name="TacticalAction">
#### Tactical Action
</a>
Most of the ship movements, planetary conquest and unit production of a game will happen during Tactical Actions.  
After declaring a Tactical Action, a player must follow the steps of the [Activation Sequence](#ActivationSequence) described below. With the exception of the first one, each of these steps is only resolved if necessary.

<a name="ActivationSequence">
***The Activation Sequence:***
</a>  

	1. System Activation
	2. Ships movement
	3. Space Cannons Fire (aka PDS Fire)
	4. Space Battle
	5. Planetary Landings
	6. Planetary Landings Resolution (aka Invasion Combat)
	7. Production

***1) System Activation***  

**Activate** a system by placing a Command Counter from the Command Pool area of your Race Sheet ("your Command Pool") in it.  
You may not activate a system that already contains one of your Command Counters, but you can activate a system that contains Command Counters from *other players*.  
In fact, as a general rule, you can ignore Command Counters belonging to other players on the galaxy.

***Important:*** When rules and effects are referring to **Activated Systems**, they refer to Systems that have been activated by the player they are mentioning.

***2) Ships movement***

> Precised in SA  
> Note that Space Mines are now placed on borders and not in Systems

In this step, you may move friendly ships **into**, and this is important, only **into the System just activated**. This means that all the ships you are moving must **end their movement in the System just activated** (except if something happens to them on their way, that would stop their movement, like a failed Gravity Rift roll).

The ship movement step can be broken down into 2 main parts:

* a) [Plotting trajectories](#PlottingTrajectories)
* b) [Executing movements](#ExecutingMovements)

<a name="PlottingTrajectories">
***a) Plotting Trajectories***  
</a>

For each friendly ship she wants to move, the active player has to plot a legal trajectory for it. A legal trajectory for a ship is a chain of adjacent systems starting from the System containing the ship and ending in the System just activated, that satisfies the following conditions:

* The starting System was **not activated** by the active player, or is the System that was just previously activated. (e.g. ships may not move out of an activated System, unless it is the System that has been activated during the step 1 of the same action)
* No System of the trajectory contains enemy ships. (e.g. ships may not move through Systems containing enemy ships)
> SA: Unlike in TI3, enemy Fighters do block movement in SA.

* The ship must have a sufficient *movement value* to follow the trajectory. By default, moving from a System to an adjacent System costs 1 movement. For example, a ship with a *movement value* of 1 can not move further away than 1 system.

*note: a ship does not need to take the shortest trajectory towards its final destination*

<a name="ExecutingMovements">
***b) Executing movements***  
</a>

> I didn't want to explain the whole thing about wormhole Space Mines and how you can cross two different Mines that are on the two ends of the same wormhole but you're only sustaining the mines once because you know it's actually the same border, except it's not a border because a wormhole links multiple systems together... So I just removed wormhole Space Mines. If someone has a suggestion to explain them clearly, concisely and in an intuitive manner, I'm all ear. Until then, no wormhole Space Mines.

*  The active player moves all ships according to their trajectory, up until they either reach its end in the just activated System, or would cross a border containing at least one non-friendly Space Mine. These ships may [pick up cargo](#PickingUpCargo) from the traversed Systems (but not land or drop any cargo).  
*  The active player [resolves all the Space Mines](#ResolvingSpaceMine) that stopped at least one ship, in the order of her choice. Note that only one Space Mine per border will effectively be resolved, as resolving a Space Mine removes all the other non-friendly Space Mines on the same border.
*  Repeat the two previous bullet-points until all ships with a trajectory are either destroyed or reached the System just activated.

<a name="ResolvingSpaceMine">
***Resolving a Space Mine*** 
</a>  
Roll a die for each non-Fighter ship that is present at the Space Mine being resolved. For each results of 8+, the owner of the ships must assign a hit to one of these non-Fighter ships.  
Then remove **all** (not just the one resolved) non-friendly Space Mines at the same border as the Space Mine just resolved.

<a name="PickingUpCargo">
***Picking up cargo***
</a>  
When a ship with the [capacity ability](#Capacity_unitAbility) starts its movement, move through a System, or simply stays in the System just activated, it may pick up units from other friendly cargo sources in the System: other friendly ships with the [capacity ability](#Capacity_unitAbility) and friendly planets.  
There are two main restrictions to this:  

* The ship must be able to carry the units picked up (the precise number and types of units a ship can carry is described by its [capacity ability](#Capacity_unitAbility)  
* No cargo may be picked up from activated Systems

***3) Space Cannons Fire***
> New: precise timing about who must take the decision to shoot first: non-active players from Speaker following Rotation Cycler, then active player.
> Formerly known as the "PDS Fire" step.


During this step, units with the Space Cannon (*n*) ability that are in the just activated System may fire at a fleet in the just activated System. There are two possibilities:

* a) If the Space Cannon unit **does not belong to the active player**, it can only fire at a fleet **belonging to the active player** in the just activated System. (e.g. it is not possible to allow third party Space Cannon units to fire at an enemy fleet by activating it)
* b) If the Space Cannon unit **belongs to the active player**, it can fire at **any** fleet in the just activated System.
> A potential problem with the wording above is that it allows the active player to fire her Space Cannon units at her own fleet.

Starting with the Speaker and following the Rotation Cycler, the non-active players may in turn shoot with their Space Cannon units. Then it is the turn of the active player.
> The above wording could use the term Rotation Order.

When a Space Cannon (*n*) unit fires, it performs *n* combat rolls. Hits must be attributed to the targeted fleet. 

***4) Space Battles***

At this time, if there are ships controlled by two different players in the just activated System, a Space Battle must be resolved.  
In this Space Battle, the active player is the *attacker*, while the other player is the *defender*. For complete rules about how to resolve a Space Battle, see the [Space Battles section](#SpaceBattles).

<a name="PlanetaryLandings_TacticalActionStep">
***5) Planetary Landings***
</a>

The Planetary Landings step is divided in two parts: the proper Planetary landings, and the Bombardment assignment.

* **Planetary landings**: The active player may land troops, PDSs and Leaders currently carried by his ships in the just activated System on planets in the same System. PDSs and Leaders landing on non-friendly planets must be accompanied by at least one troop.
* **Bombardment assignment**: The active player may assign some of his ships in the just activated System with the *Bombardment* ability to the non-friendly planets of this System, in order to bombard them during the 6) Planetary Landing resolution step. 

<a name="PlanetaryLandingsResolution_TacticalActionStep">
***6) Planetary Landings resolution***
</a>
> Formerly known as the "Invasion Combat" step.

Until all planets in the just activated System have been resolved, the active player chooses an unresolved planet and resolves it according to the following:
(In what follows, "landed" troops, PDSs and Leaders refer to the troops, PDSs and Leaders that were landed on the planet being resolved)

> Could be cool to have "friendly", "neutral" and "hostile" in colour, but I did not find how to do it yet.  

* a) The planet is **friendly**:    
 Place the landed troops, PDSs and Leaders on the planet.
* b) The planet is **neutral**:  
The active player must resolve the Domain Counters present on the planet (if there is any), in the order defined in the [Domain Counters section](#GameConcepts_DomainCounters). If there are still landed troops after resolving the Domain Counters, place all landed units and Leaders on the planet and the active player takes control of it, exhausted; else, destroy all landed PDSs and make a Fate Roll for each landed Leader.
* c) The planet is **controlled by an opponent**:  
	* c-1) The planet **contains at least one enemy troop or PDS**:  
	Resolve an [Invasion Combat](#InvasionCombats) on this planet.
	* c-2) The planet **does not contain any enemy troop and PDS**:  
	The ships assigned to this planet may [bombard](#) it. Then place all landed troop, PDSs and Leaders on the planet and the active player takes control of it, exhausted.  


***7) Production***  
Note: All the resources that the active player decides to spend during this step may be added up and spent at once at the end of the step. The total amount of resources that must be spend is rounded up. 

> Ditched the "at least one Cruiser -> at most 2 Space Mines". Let's be modular. Each unit with the Deploy Space Mines (*n*) ability may deploy up to *n* Space Mines.

* **Deploy Space Mines**:  
The active player may deploy a number of Space Mines in the just activated System up to the number of [Deploy Space Mines](#DeploySpaceMines_unitAbility) abilities her units in the System have  (in most cases, Space Mines will be deployed by Cruisers, each of them being able to deploy two of them). Each Space Mine costs two resources and must be placed on one of the borders of the System (Wormholes are not borders)  
>There is a problem with the Arborec racial that gives them production capacity for their Ground Forces. As it currently stands, their *planets* get the production capacity, which just does not work well with the Space Dock-centric production model of this rulebook. I could define planets with production capacity, but that would be a lengthy rule (to clarify what happens when there is a Space Dock on the same planet, and what happens when this Space Dock cannot produce units for some reason) for a single use-case. So I think that it would be the job of the text of the racial ability to clarify these issues itself.  

* **Produce units**:  
The active player may produce units at each of her units with the [Produce Units (*n*) ability](#ProduceUnits_unitAbility) in the just activated Systems, with a *production capacity* of *n*. In most cases, units will be produced by **unexhausted** Space Docks, that have as many *production capacity* as the resource value of the planet they are on plus two.  
* **Build Space Docks**:  
The active player may build Space Docks on some of the planets in the just activated System. A Space Dock may only be built on a planet that she has controlled since the beginning of the Round, and that does not already have a Space Dock. Newly built Space Docks are placed **exhausted** (flipped) and may thus not produce units until they are refreshed (usually during the Status Phase).  

***Producing units***  
When producing units, any combination of units may be produced provided the following four limitations are respected and it can be placed in the System (see [placing produced units](#PlacingProducedUnits)):
  
* **Production Capacity**: Each unit has a production capacity cost, the total production capacity cost of the produced units may not exceed the production capacity of the unit producing them.
* **Fleet Supply**: No ships may be produced if they would violate the [Fleet Supply limit](#FleetSupply) of the System.  
* **Fighter Capacity**: The System must have a sufficient [Fighter Capacity](#Capacity_unitAbility) to support the produced Fighters.
* **Resource Cost**: Each unit has a resource cost. The player producing units must spend the required amount of resources.  

<a name="PlacingProducedUnits">
***Placing produced units***
</a>  
> New: placement of troops and PDSs produced by units in space  

After units have been produced, they must be placed according to the following rules. The *producer* refers to the unit that produced them:  

* Ships are placed in the space of the System containing the *producer*
* If the *producer* is on a planet, then all produces troops and PDSs must be placed on the same planet. Else, they may be distributed in the System among friendly planets and friendly units with sufficient [capacity](#Capacity_unitAbility) to carry them.

<a name="StatusPhase">
### Status Phase
</a>

After the Strategy Phase and the Action Phase comes the Status Phase. During this phase, players claim objectives granting them Victory Points, research Racial Improvements, and "clean up the table" for the next Round.

***The Status Sequence:***
</a>  
> I am voluntarily excluding the "Pay upkeep for Fleet Supply > 8" step from the Status Phase sequence. It does not have enough effects in normal games to justify its word count and learning time. It could become part of a set of optional rules related to epic games with huge maps and high Victory Point goal.   
> Made slight changes to the names of the step to better reflect their content  
> Added a "Scuttling" step at the end of the sequence.

	1. Claim Objectives
	2. Progression Feedback to Victory Point Leader
	3. Unlock Racial Improvements
	4. Produce Trade Goods (2:1)
	5. Refresh Planets
	6. Receive 1 Action Card, 1 Political Card and 2 Command Counters
	7. Reallocate Command Counters
	8. Scuttling
	9. Remove Command Counters from the board, return Strategy Cards, repair units, refresh Space Docks

  
***1) Claim Objectives***  

In this step, players claim objectives, which gives them Victory Points, eventually allowing them to win the game.

**Claiming an Objective**  
In order to claim an objective, a player must satisfy the requirements written on it, and not have already claimed it in the past (whether other players have already claimed it or not does not matter). The player then places a flag on the objective, and advances her flag on the Victory Point Track by the number of Victory Points granted by the objective.

**Claiming Limit**  
During a Claim Objective step, a player:  

* May claim:
	* At most 1 revealed Public Objective (either from Stage 1 or [Stage 2](#Stage2PublicObjectives) (Stage 2 Objectives may only be claimed if Stage 2 has been initiated))
	* At most 1 [Secret Objective](#SecretObjectives) from her hand
	* The [Preliminary Objective](#PreliminaryObjectives) (if it is still claimable)
* Must claim:
	* All [Special Objectives](#SpecialObjectives) she qualifies for

<a name="Stage2PublicObjectives">
**Stage 2 Public Objectives (Blue)**
</a>  
Stage 2 Public Objectives are harder Objectives that grant more Victory Points than Stage 1 ones. However, a player may only claim a Stage 2 Public Objective if the number of revealed Stage 1 Public Objectives is equal or higher to the Victory Point goal of the game (10 by default).

<a name="PreliminaryObjectives">
**Preliminary Objectives (Grey)**  
</a>
At the end of a Round in which a Preliminary Objective has been claimed by at least one player, it becomes unclaimable by any other player for the rest of the game. This creates a race among players to score them as early as possible.

<a name="SecretObjectives">
**Secret Objectives (Red)**
</a>  
When claiming a Secret Objective, a player must reveal it and show she indeed meets its requirements. If she does not meet them, the Secret Objective is discarded.


<a name="SpecialObjectives">
**Special Objectives (Green)**
</a>  
There are three kind of Special Objectives:
  
* *The Artifact Objectives* award Victory Points to the players controlling some of the four [Artifacts](#Artifact).
* *Sovereign and Imperial* award Victory Points to the players controlling respectively more than 8 and 12 planets.
* *Voice of the Council* awards a Victory Point to the player that was elected [Voice of the Council](#VoiceOfTheCouncil) during the [Twilight Council](#GameConcepts_TwilightCouncil).

Special Objectives differ from the other kinds of objective in that if a player that has claimed one of them stop meeting its requirements, her claim on the Special Objective is lost **instantly**: she must remove her flag from the objective card and lose the associated Victory Points **immediately**.  

**Winning the game**  
After all players have finished claiming objectives, if at least one of them has the required amount of Victory Point (or more) that was decided at the start of the game, the game ends.  
Whoever has the most Victory Points at that time is declared winner. If two or more players have the same number of Victory Points, ties are broken in favour of the one controlling the most planets outside of his Home System. If there is still a tie, tied players share the victory.

	She has gained the power needed to claim the for too long empty Imperial Throne on Mecatol Rex. The Winnaran Custodians will step aside for their new Empress, who must lead the galaxy to a new age of prosperity, peace and enlightenment.

Note that it is possible for a player to win the game outside of the Status Phase (some effects grant Victory Points during the Action Phase). If a player reaches the required amount of Victory Point at any time outside of the Status Phase, the game ends immediately and a victor is determined following the same procedure as above.

***2) Progression Feedback to Victory Point Leader***  
> New in SA  

The player with the most Victory Points gains as many Trade Goods as his Victory Point lead over the player with the second-most Victory Points.


***3) Unlock Racial Improvements***
> New in SA  

Starting with the Speaker and following the Rotation Cycler, each player may now unlock some of his Racial Improvements (also known as "Racial Technologies") by spending resources.

The cost of unlocking a Racial Improvement is computed as follows:  

	Base cost (printed on the card) - Victory Points (owned by the player) + Base costs of the other Racial Improvements the player has already unlocked 

Multiple Racial Improvements can be unlocked at the same time, but they must be unlocked one after the other.

***4) Produce Trade Goods (2:1)***  
> New in SA  

Starting with the Speaker and following the Rotation Cycler, each player may spend resources to receive one Trade Good for each two resources spent.

<a name="StatusPhase_RefreshPlanetsStep">
***5) Refresh Planets***
</a>  
> New in SA: Facilities are built at this step rather than during Tactical Action.  
> Change: Refresh abilities are used by not refreshing the planet, instead of requiring the exhaustion of the planet. 

Starting with the Speaker, and following the Rotation Cycler, each player refreshes his planets, by turning the corresponding planet cards upright.  
Instead of refreshing a planet at this step, players may either:

* Build a [Facility](#Facility) on the planet, provided it does not already have one.
* Use the [refresh ability](#RefreshAbility) of the planet, if it has one.

**Note:** "Instead of refreshing" means that the planet stays in the state it was in before this step. So for example, a refreshed planet on which a Facility is built stays refreshed.


***6) Receive 1 Action Card, 1 Political Card and 2 Command Counters***

Starting with the Speaker and following the Rotation Cycler, each player draws one [Action Card](#GameConcepts_ActionCards), one [Political Card](#GameConcepts_PoliticalCards), and receives two [Command Counters](#GameConcept_CommandCounter).

***7) Reallocate Command Counters***

Starting with the Speaker and following the Rotation Cycler, each player may redistribute his Command Counters between the Command Pool, Fleet Supply and Strategy Allocation areas of her race sheet. 

***8) Scuttling***  
Starting with the Speaker and following the Rotation Cycler, players may scuttle some of their units on the board by placing them in [reinforcements](#Reinforcements).

***9) Remove Command Counters from the board, return Strategy Cards, repair units, refresh Space Docks***  

* Command Counters on the board are removed and placed in [reinforcements](#Reinforcements).
* Strategy Cards are returned to the common play area.
* Units with used [Sustain Damage abilities](#SustainDamage_unitAbility) are repaired.
* Space Docks are refreshed


**The end of the Status Phase marks the end of the Round. If no player has won the game yet, a new Round begins.**

<a name="SpaceBattles">
## Space Battles
</a>  
> From TI3 to SA: Forget the terms "Withdrawals" and "Tactical Retreats". They have been unified under a single and simple system called "Retreat".  
> From SA to this rulebook: Checking when Space Battles are over is now done *before* any Combat Round would start.
> From SA to this rulebook: Adjustments to the retreat system (defender gets the chance to announce a retreat before the attacker, retreat destination is chosen when the retreat is *executed*.).
> From SA to this rulebook: Changed the names of the "Roll Combat Dice" and "Remove Casualties" to respectively "Perform Combat Rolls" and "Assign Hits" for increased rule consistency. (No actual gameplay impact)

This section details how to resolve Space Battles. Space Battles are ships versus ships engagements.

A Space Battle consists of a *Pre-Combat* phase, followed by a succession of *Combat Rounds* that continues as long as both players have ships in the System the Space Battle takes place in.

The Space Battle sequence:

	1) Pre-Combat
	1.a) Anti-Fighter Barrage
	1.b) Other Pre-Combat effects

	2) Combat Round
	2.a) Announce Retreats
	2.b) Perform Combat Rolls
	2.c) Assign Hits
	2.d) Execute Retreats

	Repeat 2) until the Space Battle ends

Here are a few definitions that will be used in the following:  

<a name="CombatRoll">**Combat Roll**</a>: The act of rolling a die and checking if its result is greater or equal to a unit's combat value. If it is, it generates a *hit*.

<a name="AssigningAHit">
**Assigning a hit**</a>:  
When her opponent generates a *hit* during a Space Battle or Invasion Combat, a player must assign it to one of her units involved in the SpaceBattle/InvasionCombat (she chooses which unit). Each unit may only be assigned at most one *hit*, and doing so destroys the unit. 

**End of a Space Battle**:  
If before a Combat Round would begin, either the attacker or the defender does not have ships in the System of the Space Battle, the Space Battle ends. If one player still has ships in the System at this point, she is declared the **winner** of the Space Battle.

### 1) Pre-Combat  
During this phase, all pre-combat effects are resolved.  
#### 1.a) Anti-Fighter Barrages
First both sides use the [Anti-Fighter Barrage abilities](#AntiFighterBarrage_unitAbility) of their involved units. The [combat rolls](#CombatRoll) are performed simultaneously, then the attacker must assign to her Fighters the hits obtained by the defender, before the defender does the same with the attacker's hits (see [assigning a hit](#AssigningAHit)).  

#### 1.b) Other Pre-Combat effects
After the Anti-Fighter Barrages, all other pre-combat effects are resolved. All pre-combat [combat rolls](#CombatRoll) granted by these effects are performed simultaneously, then the attacker assigns to her units the hits obtained by the defender, before the defender does the same with the attacker's hits (see [assigning a hit](#AssigningAHit)).  

### 2) Space Battle Combat Round  
#### 2.a) Announce Retreats
At this step, the defender may choose to announce a retreat. If she does not announce a retreat, then the attacker may announce a retreat. For now, these are just announcements, the actual retreats are executed at a later step of the Combat Round.

#### 2.b) Perform Combat Rolls  
Each ship in the System of the Space Battle performs as many [Combat Rolls](#CombatRoll) as its [Combat Dice](#CombatDice) characteristic. All dice are rolled simultaneously.

#### 2.c) Assign Hits  
First, the **attacker** must assign to her ships the hits obtained by the **defender**. Then the defender does the same with the attacker's hits.

#### 2.d) Execute Retreats  
If a player announced a retreat previously in the Combat Round, **and there are still ships from both the attacker and the defender in the System of the Space Battle** (else the retreat is cancelled), then she must now designate  a destination System for the retreat, called the **Retreat System**, satisfying the following:

* The Retreat System does not contain enemy ships
* There is no non-friendly Space Mines between the Retreat System and the System of the Space Battle.
* If the System of the Space Battle is activated, then the retreating player must spend a Command Counter from [Strategy Allocation](#StrategyAllocation) in order to choose an unactivated System as the Retreat System.

If no possible Retreat System exists, the retreat is cancelled. Else, the retreating player must place one of her Command Counter from [reinforcements](#Reinforcements) in the Retreat System and move all of her ships from the System of the Space Battle to this System.

<a name="InvasionCombats">
## Invasion Combats
</a>  
This section details how to resolve Invasion Combats. Invasion Combats are fights on planets, that occur when, during the Planetary Landing step of a Tactical Action, the active player lands troops on an enemy planet that contains troops and/or PDSs. The player that landed troops is the *attacker*, the other player is the *defender*.

Like Space Battles, Invasion Combats consist of a *Pre-Combat* phase, followed by a succession of *Combat Rounds* that continues as long as both players have troops on the planet the Invasion Combat takes place on.

**End of an Invasion Combat**:  
If before a Combat Round would begin, either the attacker or the defender does not have troops on the planet the Invasion Combat is taking place, the Invasion Combat ends.  

* If the attacker still has troops on the planet at this point, she wins the Invasion Combat. The defender's [installations](#Installation) on the planet are destroyed, and each of her [Leaders](#Leader) on it must make a [Fate Roll](#FateRoll), then the attacker takes control of the planet, exhausted. Finally, the attacker may replace one of his [Ground Forces](#GroundForce) on the planet with a [Shock Troop](#ShockTroop).
* Else (if the attacker no longer has troops on the planet, regardless of whether the defender has any), the defender wins the Invasion Combat. The attacker's [PDSs](#PDS) on the planet are destroyed, and each of her [Leaders](#Leader) on it must make a [Fate Roll](#FateRoll).

The Invasion Combat sequence:

	1) Pre-Combat
	1.a) Bombardment
	1.b) PDS fire

	2) Combat Round
	2.b) Perform Combat Rolls
	2.c) Assign Hits

	Repeat 2) until the Space Battle ends


### 1) Pre-Combat  
<a name="InvasionCombatBombardment">
#### 1.a) Bombardment  
</a>  
Ships with the [bombardment (*n*) ability](#Bombardment_unitAbility) that have been assigned to bombard this planet in the previous [Planetary Landing step](#PlanetaryLandings_TacticalActionStep) bombard it.  
Each bombarding ship performs *n* combat rolls. Deduce from the number of hits obtained the number of [planetary shields](#PlanetaryShield_unitAbility) the units on the planet have. The result is the number of hits the owner of the planet must assign to his troops on the planet.  

**Bombarding to neutrality**: If the owner of a bombarded planet is unable to assign all the bombardment hits the planet received (because she did not have enough troops), then the bombarding player may choose to [turn the planet neutral](#PlanetTurnsNeutral). All the installations on the planet are destroyed and all Leaders present on it must make a Fate Roll.  

#### 1.b) PDS fire  
The PDS *of the defender* present on the planet may each perform one combat roll. The attacker must assign the hits to his troops on the planet.

### 2) Invasion Combat Combat Round  
#### 2.a) Perform Combat Rolls  
Each troop on the planet performs as many [Combat Rolls](#CombatRoll) as its [Combat Dice](#CombatDice) characteristic. All dice are rolled simultaneously.

#### 2.b) Assign Hits  
First, the **attacker** must assign to her troops the hits obtained by the **defender**. Then the defender does the same with the attacker's hits.

<a name="System">
## Systems
</a>

The hexagons that make up the galaxy map are called Systems. There are three types of Systems: Home Systems, Special Systems and Regular Systems.  

### Control of a System
A player **controls** a System if she has at least one ship in it and controls all of its planets.

### Home Systems (Yellow Borders)
> TI3->SA: Some special rules have been added to Home Systems.
[image]  
Each race has one of these Systems, that contain the race's home worlds and constitute their starting position in the game.

***Special rules:*** 

* During the first Round of a game, players may not activate the Home System of another race than the one they play.
* A player that does not control all the planets of his race's Home System suffers a -2 Victory Points penalty. This penalty disappears as soon as she takes these planets back.
* At the beginning of the Strategy Phase, players regain control of the planets in their race's Home System that do not contain any enemy troop. These planets are acquired exhausted.
* A player does not need to have been in control of the planets of his Home System since the beginning of the Round in order to build Space Docks on them.

### Special Systems (Red Borders) 
***Note:*** *"Moving through" a System means moving inside and outside in the same movement.*

#### Asteroid Field
[image]  

* Ships may not stop inside an Asteroid Field.
* Ships may not move through an Asteroid Field.
* The Space Cannon ability may not fire at an Asteroid Field.

#### Ion Storm
[image]  

* Ships may not move through an Ion Storm
* The Space Cannon ability may not fire at an Ion Storm.
* Fighters in an Ion Storm cannot perform Combat Rolls.

#### Nebula
[image]  

* Ships may not move through a Nebula.
* Ships inside a Nebula have a movement value of 1 that cannot be increased by any effect.
* During Space Battles in a Nebula, the defending fleets receives +1 to all its combat rolls.


#### Supernova
[image]  

* Ships may not stop inside a Supernova.
* Ships may not move through a Supernova.

#### Gravity Rift
[image]  

* Moving through a Gravity Rift costs 1 movement instead of 2, unless moving in a straight line.
* Roll one die for each ship moving through a Gravity Rift. On a roll of 1,2 or 3, the ship ends its move in it, and the System becomes activated (from reinforcement).  
If enemy ships are present in the System, the ship is destroyed instead.
* Ships in a Gravity Rift do not block enemy movement through the System.

### Regular Systems
[image]  
Systems that are neither Home Systems nor Special Systems are **Regular Systems**. Usually, the majority of the Systems of a galaxy are Regular Systems.  
**Void Systems** are Regular Systems that do not contain any planet.

<a name="Planet">
## Planets
</a>

[images of planets, with tech specs and refresh abilities]  
Each planet has a [resource](#GameConcept_ResourceAndInfluence) value (the number on a green background) and an [influence](#GameConcept_ResourceAndInfluence) (the number on a red background). Planets may also feature a number of [Technology Specialties](#TechnologySpecialty) (red/green/blue/yellow technology symbols), and a [Refresh Ability](#RefreshAbility) (symbol depending on the actual refresh ability). 

### Planet Card
Each planet has an associated planet card. When a player takes control of a planet, she takes the corresponding planet card. 

### Planet Control
Planets are usually acquired by landing troops on them during the Planetary Landing step of a Tactical Action, but there are other ways. When a player acquires a planet, the planet is received **exhausted** (and the planet card is rotated to indicate this fact).  

A player does not need to keep troops on a planet to retain control of it. If no units remain on a controlled planet, its controller must place a flag to indicate he still controls the planet.

### Refreshed and Exhausted states
[image with a refreshed planet card and an exhausted one]  
Planets can exist in two states: **refreshed** and **exhausted**. When a planet is refreshed, its planet card is upright, and its controller may use it to for example pay the production cost of some units. When a planet is exhausted, its planet card is rotated, and its controller does not get any benefit from it until it is refreshed (which usually happens during the Status Phase).


<a name="TechnologySpecialty">
### Technology Specialties
</a>
[image of the 4 possible Tech spec symbol]  
Technology Specialties represent a certain local knowledge or a natural resource important to a specific research field.  
Each Technology Specialty on a **refreshed** planet reduces by 1 (down to a minimum of 0) the cost of purchasing a Technology of the same colour via the Secondary Ability of the Technology Strategy Card, for the controller of the planet.

<a name="RefreshAbility">
### Refresh Abilities
</a>
[image of some refresh abilities symbols]  
A Refresh Ability is indicated by a symbol on the right of a planet's influence value, and is detailed on the associated planet card.  
Refresh Abilities can be used during the [Refresh Planets step of the Status Phase](#StatusPhase_RefreshPlanetsStep), by *not* refreshing the planet.

<a name="Facility">
### Facilities
</a>
> TI3->SA: No limits on the number of Facility cards available (instead of 8 of each type)  
> TI3->SA: Important changes in the way Facilities are built.

Facilities are [Installations](#Installation) that can be built on planets to increase their resource or influence value.  
There are two types of Facilities: Refineries and Colonies. Refineries increase the resource value of the planets they are on by 1, while Colonies do the same for the influence value.    
Facilities are not built for resources. Instead, a Facility may be placed on a planet *instead* of normally refreshing it during the [Refresh Planets step of the Status Phase](#StatusPhase_RefreshPlanetsStep), *if the planet did not previously contain one*.  
Once built, place the Facility card under the planet card, with the bottom edge sticking out to display the +1 in either resource or influence.  

<a name="PlanetTurnsNeutral">
### "Turning Neutral"
</a>
When a planet **"turns neutral"** (because of a game effect), all units and Facilities on it are destroyed, and each Leader on it must make a [Fate Roll](#FateRoll). The current controller of the planet also loses control of it.

### Trade Stations
> TI3->SA Trade Stations are acquired at the end of actions, instead of whenever a player is the only one having ships in the system.

Trade Stations are a specific type of planets, with the following special rules:

* No [Domain Counter](#GameConcepts_DomainCounters) may exist on a Trade Station.
* Troops, Installations and Leaders may not exist on Trade Stations, and no Invasion Combat or bombardment may be conducted against them.
* A player takes control of a Trade Station when she is the only one having ships in its System at the end of an action. She retains control of it even if she stops having ships in the System, until another player takes control of it.  
* A player cannot lose control of a Trade Station for any reason if she has ships in its system.

## Other Board Elements
> Recent in SA: New [Worldgate](#Worldgate) token.

### Border Tokens
These tokens are placed on the border between two Systems.

#### Asteroid Belts
[image]  

* Ships may not move through Asteroid Belts
* The Space Cannon ability may not fire through an Asteroid Belt.

### Wormholes
[image]
>TI3->SA: Wormholes make systems adjacent **for all purposes**.  
> TI3->SA: Wormhole Tokens flip when used.

Wormholes are spatial anomalies that connect distant areas of space.

Two Systems containing wormholes of the same type are considered adjacent for all purposes.

#### Wormhole tokens
Wormhole Tokens have different Wormholes printed on each side of the token.
At the end of an action in which at least one ship moved through such Wormhole, the token is flipped, changing the type of the Wormhole.

#### Definitions
***Stable Wormholes*** are Wormholes that are directly printed on a tile.

***Unstable Wormholes*** are all the Wormholes that are *not* printed on a tile. (Wormholes from [Domain Counters](#GameConcepts_DomainCounters), Wormhole Tokens...)

<a name="Artifact">
### Artifacts
</a>

> TI3->SA: Artifacts may exist in space.  
[images of both real and dummy artefacts]  

There are eight Artifact tokens. Four of them harbor technology colors and are actual Artifacts, while the other four have [Trade Goods](#GameConcepts_TradeGoods) symbols and are called **Dummy Artifacts**. 

Artifacts may exist on planets or in space, are placed on the galaxy when it is created and may not be moved or destroyed by players.

#### Controlling Artifacts
* ***Artifact on a Planet***  
Whoever controls the planet controls the Artifact.
* ***Artifact in Space***  
A player takes control of an Artifact in space when she is the only one having ships in its System at the end of an action. She retains control of it even if she stops having ships in the System, until another player takes control of it. 

When a player takes control of a facedown Artifacts, she flips it. The Artifact will stay in this state for the rest of the game.

#### Dummy Artifacts
When a Dummy Artifacts is revealed, it is removed from the game and its controller receives 2 Trade Goods.

#### Artifacts-related Special Objectives
There are four [Special Objective](#SpecialObjectives) awarding Victory Points for the control of the four non-Dummy Artifacts.

#### Artifact Technology Discounts
The controller of an Artifact reduces her cost to purchase Technologies of the same color by 1.

<a name="Worldgate">
### Worldgates
</a>
[image]  
Worldgates are placed on some planets of the galaxy when it is created and may not be moved or destroyed by players.

When a player performs a Tactical Action in a System containing planets with Worldgates, she may, during the [Planetary Landing step](#PlanetaryLandings_TacticalActionStep), move any number of her troops, PDSs and Leaders from other planets in *unactivated Systems* that also contain Worldgates to these planets. Treat units and Leaders moved this way as if they had been normally landed on the planets.

<a name="CombatDice">
Combat Dice:</a> A unit characteristic. The number of combat rolls it performs during the combat rounds of Space Battles (if the unit is a ship) or Invasion Combats (if it is a troop).  
Note that if after all modifiers have been taken into account, a unit would have zero or less Combat Dice, it is considered as having one Combat Dice instead.
