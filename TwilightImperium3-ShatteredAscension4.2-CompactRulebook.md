# Shattered Ascension Compact Rulebook  - v3_23/01/2017

#### Note on Contradictions
If the text of a component (card, technology,...) would contradict with the rules presented in this rulebook, the component takes precedence. 

## Overview
### Game Overview
In a game of Twilight Imperium, 2 to 8 players take the role of varied great races fighting for supremacy in the galaxy after the ruling Lazax Empire has fallen. The game is played over several rounds, during which players strive to fulfil Objectives in order to score Victory Points. The first player to reach a predetermined number of Victory Points is declared the winner and the new Emperor of the Galaxy.
	
### Components Overview
#### Systems
[image]  
Every game, these hexagonal tiles will be assembled to create the game board: the galaxy. They represent areas of space and may contain planets or other elements of interest.  
[More details on Systems](#GameConcepts_Systems)

#### Units
[image]  
These detailed plastic pieces represent the military personnel, shipyards, defence systems, and spaceships that players will command. 
[More details on Units](#GameConcepts_Units)

#### Planet Cards
[image]  
Each of these cards corresponds to a planet present in one of the systems. They are used to indicate the ownership over the planets, and whether they have been "exhausted" by their owner.  
[More details on Planets](#GameConcepts_Planets)

#### Technology Tree
[image]  
This tree depicts all the technologies the players can acquire in the game, and help them to keep track of those that they already have. 
[More details on Technologies](#GameConcepts_Technologies)

#### Action Cards
[image]  
These cards are acquired by players throughout the game, and can be used to provide various effects.  
[More details on Action Cards](#GameConcepts_ActionCards)

#### Political Cards
[image]  
These cards represent the agendas that the players will vote on at the Galactic Council located on Mecatol Rex.  
[More details on Political Cards](#GameConcepts_PoliticalCards)

#### Objective Cards
[image of Preliminary, Public Stage1, Public Stage2, Secret and Special objectives]  
In order to win a game of Twilight Imperium, players need to accumulate victory points. This is mostly done by qualifying for the requirements of the Objective Cards.  
[More details on Objective Cards](#GameConcepts_ObjectiveCards)

#### Artefact Tokens
[image]  
These tokens are placed either on planets or in space, and give benefits to their controller.  
[More details on Artefacts](#GameConcepts_Artefacts)

#### Trade Agreement cards
[image]  
Each race has some of these cards, and uses them to trade with other races.  
[More details on Trade](#GameConcepts_Trade)

<a name="StrategyCards">
#### Strategy Cards (and the High Alert token)
</a>
[image]  
These cards represent powerful short-term strategies the players can choose from each round, during the [Strategy Phase](#StrategyPhase). The Warfare (number 6) Strategy Card comes with the High Alert token. They are played through [Strategic Actions](#StrategicAction). 

#### Bonus Counters
[image]  
These counters are placed on unpicked [Strategy Cards](#StrategyCards) to make them more attractive.

#### Command Counters
[image]  
These counters represent the domestic mandates and logisitics of the races. They are used by players for various actions, such as moving units on the board through [Tactical Actions](#TacticalAction).

#### Control Markers (also called "Flags")
[image]  
These markers are used to represent the races in various places

#### Trade Goods
[image]  
These tokens represent wealth. They are used as currency, and can be exchanged between players.  
[More details on Trade Goods](#GameConcepts_TradeGoods).

#### The Victory Point Track
[image]
During the setup of the game, each player places a flag on the Victory Point Track, to track the number of his Victory Points throughout the game.

#### The Speaker Token and the Rotation Cycler
[image]
The holder of the Speaker Token (called the Speaker) chooses first his [Strategy Cards](#StrategyCards) during the Strategy Phase, and break ties during the [Galactic Council](#GameConcepts_GalacticCouncil).  
The Rotation Cycler determine the order

#### The Rotation Cycler

## Goal of the Game (Overview)

A game of Shattered Ascension is a succession of Rounds. At the end of each Round, players can acquire Victory Points by claiming various Objectives. If a player ends a Round with at least as many Victory Points as the limit that was decided at the beginning of the game (usually 10), he is declared winner.

<a name="Setup_BuildingTheGalaxy">
**1) Building the Galaxy**
</a>

> I put the creation of a pre set map before everything else, because then you can set it up in advance, and it's how we do it in TTS, and it works better. 

Choose either:
 
* Choose and build a pre-set map from [Shattered Ascension Map Database](http://www.astralvault.net/games/SA/maps.html)
* Decide to have the player build the map following the [Star by Star procedure](#StarByStar). In this case, the map will be built at step 6.

<a name="Setup_TableSetup">
**2) Table Setup**  
</a> 

> Again, this step is at the top, because it doesn't require cerebral activity and can be done in advance.

Find an area of the table that is convenient for all players to reach. Designate this 
space the *common play area*, and populate it with the following:

* Action Cards deck
* Polical Cards deck
* Ground Force and Fighter tokens
* Trade Goods tokens
* Planet Cards deck
* The Strategy Cards from number 1 to 8. Add in the 9th if there are 4, 7 or 8 players.
* The Objective deck: all the Stage I Objective Cards.
* The Special Objective Cards
* The Victory Point track

Inside this common play area, designate a space that will be used as the *Galactic Council*.  

<a name="Setup_VictoryPointGoal">
**3) Victory Point Goal**  
</a> 

Decide on the number of Victory Points required to win. The recommanded values are:

* 8 Victory Points for duels
* 10 Victory Points for normal games
* 14 Victory Points for epic (long) games

<a name="Setup_GameOptions">
**4) Game Options**  
</a>
> Twilight Council is no more an option, it is part of SA.

Decide on the game options to include:

* [Path of Fate](#PathOfFate) (Race-Specific Objectives)
* [Simultaneous Action System](#SimultaneousActionSystem)
* [Ascendancy](#Ascendancy) (essentially doubles the Victory Point goal and makes objectives claimable multiple times)

<a name="Setup_SecretObjectives">
**5) Secret Objectives**  
</a>

If this game is not a duel, deal two Secret Objective cards to each player. They will have to discard one of them later.

<a name="Setup_RacePicking">
**6) Race Picking** 
</a>

> For the race picking and biddings, the SA patchrule starts with either the highest or lowest rolling player and go either clockwise or counter clockwise, but since we use the rolling order in TTS, I thought I may as well write the rule for it.

* Have each player roll a die. Remember the results, as they will be used in the following setup steps as well.
*  Starting with the highest rolling player in **decreasing rolling order**, each player may either choose any availlable race to command or pass. The unchosen races form the pool of random races.
*  All players without a race are **secretly** dealt a random race from the pool. They may either keep it, or reshuffle it into the pool (without revealing them).
*  Conduct the above step a second time.
*  All player without a race are **publicly** dealt a random race from the pool, that they must play for this game.

<a name="Setup_HSLocationBiddingORGalaxyBuilding">
**7) Home System Location Bidding OR Galaxy Building**
</a>

*Note: The Trade Goods that are bid at this step are taken from the reserve, not from the players.*

If you chose a pre-set map, then players will now bid on the Home System location they wish to start on.  
The highest rolling player places a race flag (or another item if her race is not public) along with a bid of Trade Goods on any Home System Location.
Then in **decreasing rolling order** (looping), each player either places a bid on a new Home System or overbid another. This continues until all players have a Home System location (skipping the turn of players who already have a Home System location).
All players add as many Trade Goods as the difference between the highest bid and their own bid to their starting Trade Goods.

If you chose to build the map using the [Star by Star procedure](#StarByStar), now is the time to do it.

*Players may now change seat in order to be aligned with their Home System location.*

<a name="Setup_SpeakerTokenBidding">
**8) Speaker Token Bidding**
</a>

*Note: The Trade Goods that are bid at this step are taken from the reserve, not from the players.*

The lowest rolling player places a bid of Trade Goods (may be 0) on the Speaker Token. Then in **increasing rolling order** (looping), each player may either withdraw from the bidding or overbid. The winner is assigned the Speaker Token/ The other players add as many Trade Goods as the winning bid to their starting Trade Goods.

<a name="Setup_StartingTradeGoodsNormalisation">
**9) Starting Trade Goods Normalisation**
</a>

All players now add or subtract the same number of Trade Goods such that the player with the lowest amount starts out with 1 Trade Good.

<a name="Setup_OrientingTheRotationCycler">
**10) Orienting the Rotation Cycler**
</a>
> This thing has its own step, that is placed AFTER the TG normalisation step, because we don't want potential TG transactions to affect the TG Normalisation. 

The player holding the Speaker Token may now set the orientation of the Rotation Cycler.

<a name="Setup_DeckBuiding">
**11) Deck Building**
</a>
> Experience shows that Shattered Ascension Stage II is not reached anyway, so no need to complicate things with another objective deck.
 
* Build the objective deck by shuffling all the Stage I Objective cards.
* Shuffle the Action Cards and Political Cards decks

<a name="Setup_RevealingObjectives">
**12) Revealing Objectives**
</a>

Reveal:

* All Special Objectives (if playing a duel, exclude Sovereign and Magisterial)
* 3 random Public Stage I Objectives
* 1 random Preliminary Objective (not if playing a duel)

<a name="Setup_FinalisingSetup">
**13) Finalising Setup**
</a>

* Each player discards a Secret Objective (the discard pile of Secret Objectives cards is NOT public)
* Each player draws 2 Political Cards
* Reveal hidden races
* Each player chooses a set of plastic miniatures and take his race's Command Counters. He places them near his race sheet. They will form his "Reinforcements".
> * I think that "Flag Token" is a better name than "Control Marker". It's more visual. And we say "flag" when we talk anyway.
> * Let's forget about the dual name "Trade Contract"-"Trade Agreement", and just call these cards "Trade Agreements", that may be either "active" or "inactive".
> * "Race-Specific Technology" -> "Racial Improvement", to show that they are really not like normal technologies.
> * "Promissory Notes" do not exist in SA.

* Each player takes the assets of his race:
	* Flag Tokens
	* Flagship card
	* Trade Agreement cards
	* Racial Improvement cards
* Each player places a Flag Token on the zero of the Victory Point Track.
* Each player places Flag Tokens on the technology tree, besides his starting technologies (indicated on his race sheet).

> "Installations" = PDSs and SpaceDocks

* Each player places his starting units and Leaders (indicated on his race sheet) in his Home Systems. Ground units and Installations may be placed on any planet. Leaders may be placed on any ships or planet.
* Each players places Command Counters from his reinforcements onto his race sheet as follows:
	* 2 in Strategy Allocation (with the race's symbol side up)
	* 3 in Command Pool (with the race's symbol side up)
	* 3 in Fleet Supply (with the ship silhouette side up)

**14) Play!**

Start the first Round.

## The Game Round

Shattered Ascension is played over a consecutive number of Rounds. Each Round is split into three phases: The [Strategy Phase](#StrategyPhase) where player place a Political Card in the Galactic Council and select their Strategy Card for the Round, the [Action Phase](#ActionPhase), where players use their Strategy Cards, move their ships, conquer planets and build units, and the [Status Phase](#StatusPhase), where the board is cleaned up and players can gain Victory Points by claiming Objectives. If no player is declared winner at the end of a Round, another Round starts.

<a name="StrategyPhase">
### Strategy Phase
</a>
The Strategy Phase is divided into three steps:  

* [Home System Planets Reclamation](#HomeSystemPlanetsReclamation)
* [Galactic Council Propositions](#GalacticCouncilPropositions)
* [Strategy Card Picking](#StrategyCardPicking)


<a name="HomeSystemPlanetsReclamation">
#### Home System Planets Reclamation
</a>
> New in SA  

During this step, players regain control of any planet that is in their Home System, does not contain any troop, and is not already under their control. These planet are acquired exhausted.

<a name="GalacticCouncilPropositions">
#### Galactic Council Propositions
</a>
> New in SA  

During this step, players will place or update their Political Card in the Galactic Council. If the Galactic Council concur this round, the agendas to be voted on will be chosen among these cards.

* Players that already have a Political Card in the Galactic Council must retake it into their hand.
* Players may, as many times as they want, discard two Political Cards from their hand to draw another Political Card.
* Then each player must place a hidden Political Card from their hand into the Galactic Council, and place one of their flag on it.  
Instead of a card from their hand, they can place the first card of the Political Card deck, without looking at it.
* Finally, when all players have done so, reveal all Political Cards in the Galactic Council.

<a name="StrategyCardPicking">
#### Strategy Card Picking
</a>
Starting with the Speaker and proceeding in the order defined by the Rotation Cycler, each player must pick one of the available Strategy Cards (that was not already picked by another player). She will be able to use it during the upcoming Action Phase.

<!-- LINK for Bonus Counter -->  
After that, place a **Bonus Counter** on each of the unpicked Strategy Cards. These Bonus Counters stacks from one Round to the next, and increase the value of the Strategy Cards are they are on: When a player picks a Strategy Card, she converts each present Bonus Counter into either a Command Counter or a Trade Goods that she adds to her race sheet.

<a name="ActionPhase">
### Action Phase
</a>
During the Action Phase, players will take Turns in the [Initiative Order](#InitiativeOrder) (see below). At her Turn, a player must perform one Action, which can be either a [Strategic Action](#StrategicAction), a [Tactical Action](#TacticalAction), or [Passing](#Passing).  Once a player has taken an Action, her Turn ends and the Turn of the next player in the [Initiative Order](#InitiativeOrder) starts. Players that have not yet passed will keep taking turns, until all of them have Passed and the Action Phase ends.

A player currently in the process of taking her turn (i.e. performing an Action) is called the **active player**.

<a name="InitiativeOrder">
***Initiative Order:*** </a>  
Each Strategy Card has an initiative number printed on it. The **initiative** of each player is the initiative number of her Strategy Card. The Initiative Order simply orders players from lowest to highest initiative.

***"as an action":***  
Some effects in the game allow players to do things "as an action". This means that using such effects uses up a Turn and is done instead of another Action.

<a name="Passing">
#### Passing
</a>
A player performs this action when she does not want to perform any other action for the rest of this Action Phase. When it would be the turn of a player that passed, simply skip her. If all players have passed, the Action Phase ends and the [Status Phase](#StatusPhase) starts.  
**Important:** A player may not pass before having used her Strategy Card through a Strategic Action.

<a name="StrategicAction">
#### Strategic Action
</a>
A Strategic Action corresponds to playing a Strategy Card. When a player performs a Strategic Action, she reads and execute for herself the **Primary Ability** of her Strategy Card, then other players, following the order defined by the Rotation Cycler (starting with either the left or right neighbour of the active player, depending on the orientation of the Rotation Cycler), may choose to execute the **Secondary Ability** of the card.  
After that the used Strategy Card is flipped on its *inactive* side, and may not be used again this Round. 

***Important:*** When performing a Strategic Action, the active player *cannot* execute the Secondary Ability of the Strategy Card she is playing.

***Hint:*** Most of the Secondary Abilities of the Strategy Cards require a Command Counter from Strategy Allocation to be spent in order to be executed. So be sure to keep at least one if you plan on using the Secondary Ability of a given Strategy Card. 

<a name="TacticalAction">
#### Tactical Action
</a>
Most of the ship movements, planetary conquest and unit production of a game will happen during Tactical Actions.  
After declaring a Tactical Action, a player must follow the steps of the [Activation Sequence](#ActivationSequence) described below. With the exception of the first one, each of these steps is only resolved if necessary.

<a name="ActivationSequence">
***The Activation Sequence:***
</a>  

	1. System Activation
	2. Ships movement
	3. Space Cannons Fire (aka PDS Fire)
	4. Space Battle
	5. Planetary Landings
	6. Planetary Landings Resolution (aka Invasion Combat)
	7. Production

***1) System Activation***  

**Activate** a system by placing a Command Counter from the Command Pool area of your Race Sheet ("your Command Pool") in it.  
You may not activate a system that already contains one of your Command Counters, but you can activate a system that contains Command Counters from *other players*.  
In fact, as a general rule, you can ignore Command Counters belonging to other players on the galaxy.

***Important:*** When rules and effects are referring to **Activated Systems**, they refer to Systems that have been activated by the player they are mentioning.

> New in SA  

You may not activate the Home System of another player during the first Round of a game.

***2) Ships movement***

> Precised in SA  
> Note that Space Mines are now placed on borders and not in Systems

In this step, you may move friendly ships **into**, and this is important, only **into the System just activated**. This means that all the ships you are moving must **end their movement in the System just activated**.

The ship movement step can be broken down into 2 main parts:

* a) [Plotting trajectories](#PlottingTrajectories)
* b) [Executing movements](#ExecutingMovements)

<a name="PlottingTrajectories">
***a) Plotting Trajectories***  
</a>

For each friendly ship she wants to move, the active player has to plot a legal trajectory for it. A legal trajectory for a ship is a chain of adjacent systems starting from the System containing the ship and ending in the System just activated, that satisfies the following conditions:

* The starting System was **not activated** by the active player, or is the System that was just previously activated. (e.g. ships may not move out of an activated System, unless it has been activated during the step 1 of the same action)
* No System of the trajectory contains enemy ships. (e.g. ships may not move through Systems containing enemy ships)
> SA: Unlike in TI3, enemy Fighters do block movement in SA.

* The trajectory doe not contain more Systems than the *movement value* of the ship +1 (for example, a ship with a *movement value* of 1 can only move to an adjacent System, because any legal trajectory for this ship cannot contain more than 2 systems)

*note: a ship does not need to take the shortest trajectory towards its final destination*

<a name="ExecutingMovements">
***b) Executing movements***  
</a>

> I didn't want to explain the whole thing about wormhole Space Mines and how you can cross two different Mines that are on the two ends of the same wormhole but you're only sustaining the mines once because you know it's actually the same border, except it's not a border because a wormhole links multiple systems together... So I just removed wormhole Space Mines. If someone has a suggestion to explain them clearly, concisely and in an intuitive manner, I'm all ear. Until then, no wormhole Space Mines.

*  The active player moves all ships according to their trajectory, up until they either reach its end in the just activated System, or would cross a border containing at least one non-friendly Space Mine. These ships may [pick up cargo](#PickingUpCargo) from the traversed Systems (but not land or drop any cargo).  
*  The active player [resolves all the Space Mines](#ResolvingSpaceMine) that stopped at least one ship, in the order of her choice. Note that only one Space Mine per border will effectively be resolved, as resolving a Space Mine removes all the other non-friendly Space Mines on the same border.
*  Repeat the two previous bullet-points until all ships with a trajectory are either destroyed or reached the System just activated.

<a name="ResolvingSpaceMine">
***Resolving a Space Mine*** 
</a>  
Roll a die for each non-Fighter ship that is present at the Space Mine being resolved. For each results of 8+, the owner of the ships must assign a hit to one of these non-Fighter ships.  
Then remove **all** (not just the one resolved) non-friendly Space Mines at the same border as the Space Mine just resolved.

<a name="PickingUpCargo">
***Picking up cargo***
</a>  
When a ship with the [capacity ability](#Capacity_unitAbility) starts its movement, move through a System, or simply stays in the System just activated, it may pick up units from other friendly cargo sources in the System: other friendly ships with the [capacity ability](#Capacity_unitAbility) and friendly planets.  
There are two main restrictions to this:  

* The ship must be able to carry the units picked up (the precise number and types of units a ship can carry is described by its [capacity ability](#Capacity_unitAbility)  
* No cargo may be picked up from activated Systems

***3) Space Cannons Fire***
> New: precise timing about who must take the decision to shoot first: non-active players from Speaker following Rotation Cycler, then active player.
> Formerly known as the "PDS Fire" step.


During this step, units with the Space Cannon (*n*) ability that are in the just activated System may fire at a fleet in the just activated System. There are two possibilities:

* a) If the Space Cannon unit **does not belong to the active player**, it can only fire at a fleet **belonging to the active player** in the just activated System. (e.g. it is not possible to allow third party Space Cannon units to fire at an enemy fleet by activating it)
* b) If the Space Cannon unit **belongs to the active player**, it can fire at **any** fleet in the just activated System.
> A potential problem with the wording above is that it allows the active player to fire her Space Cannon units at her own fleet.

Starting with the Speaker and following the Rotation Cycler, the non-active players may in turn shoot with their Space Cannon units. Then it is the turn of the active player.
> The above wording could use the term Rotation Order.

When a Space Cannon (*n*) unit fires, it performs *n* combat rolls. Hits must be attributed to the targeted fleet. 

***4) Space Battles***

At this time, if there are ships controlled by two different players in the just activated System, a Space Battle must be resolved.  
In this Space Battle, the active player is the *attacker*, while the other player is the defender*. For complete rules about how to resolve a Space Battle, see the [Space Battles section](#SpaceBattles).

***5) Planetary Landings***

The Planetary Landings step is divided in two parts: the proper Planetary landings, and the Bombardment assignment.

* **Planetary landings**: The active player may land ground units, PDSs and Leaders currently carried by his ships in the just activated System on the planets in the same System. PDSs and Leaders landing on non-friendly planets must be accompanied by at least one ground unit.
* **Bombardment assignment**: The active player may assign some of his ships in the just activated System with the *Bombardment* ability to the non-friendly planets of this System, in order to bombard them during the 6) Planetary Landing resolution step. 

***6) Planetary Landings resolution***
> Formerly known as the "Invasion Combat" step.

Until all planets in the just activated System have been resolved, the active player chooses an unresolved planet and resolve it according to the following:
(In what follows, "landed" ground units, PDSs and Leaders refer to the ground units, PDSs and Leaders that were landed on the planet being resolved)

> Could be cool to have "friendly", "neutral" and "hostile" in colour, but I did not find how to do it yet.  

* a) The planet is **friendly**:    
 Place the landed ground units, PDSs and Leaders on the planet.
* b) The planet is **neutral**:  
The active player must resolve the Domain Counters present on the planet (if there is any), in the order defined in the [Domain Counters section](#GameConcepts_DomainCounters). If there are still landed ground units after resolving the Domain Counters, place all landed units and Leaders on the planet and the active player takes control of it; else, destroy all landed PDSs and make a Fate Roll for each landed Leader.
* c) The planet is **controlled by an opponent**:  
	* c-1) The planet **contains at least one enemy ground unit or PDS**:  
	Resolve an [Invasion Combat](#InvasionCombats) on this planet.
	* c-2) The planet **does not contain any enemy ground unit and PDS**:  
	The ships assigned to this planet may bombard it. Then place all landed ground units, PDSs and Leaders on the planet and the active player takes control of it.  


***7) Production***  
Note: All the resources that the active player decides to spend during this step may be added up and spent at once at the end of the step. The total amount of resources that must be spend is rounded up. 

> Ditched the "at least one Cruiser -> at most 2 Space Mines". Let's be modular. Each unit with the Deploy Space Mines (*n*) ability may deploy up to *n* Space Mines.

* **Deploy Space Mines**:  
The active player may deploy a number of Space Mines in the just activated System up to the number of [Deploy Space Mines](#DeploySpaceMines_unitAbility) abilities her units in the System have  (in most cases, Space Mines will be deployed by Cruisers, each of them being able to deploy two of them). Each Space Mine costs two resources and must be placed on one of the borders of the System (Wormholes are not borders)  
>There is a problem with the Arborec racial that gives them production capacity for their Ground Forces. As it currently stands, their *planets* get the production capacity, which just does not work well with the Space Dock-centric production model of this rulebook. I could define planets with production capacity, but that would be a lengthy rule (to clarify what happens when there is a Space Dock on the same planet, and what happens when this Space Dock cannot produce units for some reason) for a single use-case. So I think that it would be the job of the text of the racial ability to clarify these issues itself.  

* **Produce units**:  
The active player may produce units at each of her units with the [Produce Units (*n*) ability](#ProduceUnits_unitAbility) in the just activated Systems, with a *production capacity* of *n*. In most cases, units will be produced by **unexhausted** Space Docks, that have as many *production capacity* as the resource value of the planet they are on plus two.  
* **Build Space Docks**:  
The active player may build Space Docks on some of the planets in the just activated System. A Space Dock may only be built on a planet that she has controlled since the beginning of the Round, and that does not already have a Space Dock. Newly built Space Docks are placed **exhausted** (flipped) and may thus not produce units until they are refreshed (usually during the Status Phase).  

***Producing units***  
When producing units, any combination of units may be produced provided the following four limitations are respected and it can be placed in the System (see [placing produced units](#PlacingProducedUnits)):
  
* **Production Capacity**: Each unit has a production capacity cost, the total production capacity cost of the produced units may not exceed the production capacity of the unit producing them.
* **Fleet Supply**: No ships may be produced if they would violate the [Fleet Supply limit](#FleetSupply) of the System.  
* **Fighter Capacity**: The System must have a sufficient [Fighter Capacity](#Capacity_unitAbility) to support the produced Fighters.
* **Resource Cost**: Each unit has a resource cost. The player producing units must spend the required amount of resources.  

<a name="PlacingProducedUnits">
***Placing produced units***
</a>  
> New: placement of troops and PDSs produced by units in space  

After units have been produced, they must be placed according to the following rules. The *producer* refers to the unit that produced them:  

* Ships are placed in the space of the System containing the *producer*
* If the *producer* is on a planet, then all produces troops and PDSs must be placed on the same planet. Else, they may be distributed in the System among friendly planets and friendly units with sufficient [capacity](#Capacity_unitAbility) to carry them.
